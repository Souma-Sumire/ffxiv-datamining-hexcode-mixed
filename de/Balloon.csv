4270,False,"How 'bout it?<hex:02100103>We could be quadruplets!"
4271,False,"Oh, well done you!<hex:02100103>I'm sure no one saw<hex:02100103>that one coming! Bah!"
4272,False,"W-Would you like to try the ceremony with me?"
4273,False,"I'd <hex:021A020203>love<hex:021A020103> to!"
4274,False,"Hah!<hex:02100103>One more time, then."
4275,False,"Let's go again, Granddad!"
4276,False,"The bulletin... Have to check the bulletin..."
4277,False,"Heh heh, clowns are funny."
4278,False,"Did you check the bulletin?"
4279,False,"I...uh... No, miss..."
4280,False,"<sigh> Go. Check. The bulletin."
4281,False,"Over there, eh?"
4282,False,"Huh? Was sure this is the spot..."
4283,False,"Has to be here, then!"
4284,False,"...No? Godsdammit!"
4285,False,"Where's this supposed to go?"
4286,False,"What now, do you think?"
4287,False,"Haven't you stared long enough?"
4288,False,"No, it's not nearly seared into my brain!"
4289,False,"Well, if the vegetables go over there..."
4290,False,"I pray this will be enough."
4291,False,"We have no reason to believe<hex:02100103>the barrier will not hold."
4292,False,"Yet if they should bring<hex:02100103>all to bear against us..."
4293,False,"We should send out a<hex:02100103>reconnaissance team."
4294,False,"I will do whatever it takes to save my patients. Whatever it takes!"
4295,False,"There's nothin' more beautiful<hex:02100103>than a sunset on the Rhotano."
4296,False,"I pray I live to see it..."
4297,False,"I fear we lack the numbers<hex:02100103>to hold out..."
4298,False,"Then we must call for<hex:02100103>reinforcements."
4299,False,"We must protect the border at all costs."
4300,False,"Till our dyin' breaths."
4301,False,"Argh..."
4302,False,"I can't feel my legs..."
4303,False,"Only once before have<hex:02100103>I bowed my head low..."
4304,False,"My body is ready for a hot meal."
4305,False,"As soon as our watch is over."
4306,False,"Gods, what I wouldn't give for a bath..."
4307,False,"●仮設定"
4308,False,"That doesn't look half bad..."
4309,False,"Sure, I'll give it a try."
4310,False,"I'd buy that for a gil..."
4311,False,"Down the hatch!"
4312,False,"The path to riches is a perilous one, yes, yes..."
4313,False,"Seven hells!<hex:02100103>Get a bloody room, will ye!?"
4314,False,"The next match is mine!"
4315,False,"Mewling cub!<hex:02100103>You'll never defeat me!"
4316,False,"I'll show ye how to swing a damn hammer!"
4317,False,"The abyss take me..."
4318,False,"Wh-Which tile should I discard...?"
4319,False,"Well, this is a disaster!"
4320,False,"And one is meant to scale this edifice...?"
4321,False,"Ulalaaa!"
4322,False,"I love you!"
4323,False,"Mashaaa!"
4324,False,"Yes!"
4325,False,"U-lah-lah!"
4326,False,"Hah! Hah!"
4327,False,"Narumiii!"
4328,False,"She looked at me!"
4329,False,"W-We're safe...?"
4330,False,"The sky..."
4331,False,"What's happening...?"
4332,False,"Lord...Vauthry..."
4333,False,"Long may...you reign..."
4334,False,"Ohhh..."
4335,False,"Hallowed be his name..."
4336,False,"Blessed is the meol..."
4337,False,"Is this supposed to be part of the show?"
4338,False,"Something's happening..."
4339,False,"Did you summon those things!?"
4340,False,"What in the gods' name is that!?"
4341,False,"That way! The crown's that way!"
4342,False,"Keep running! You're almost there!"
4343,False,"Phew, we did it..."
4344,False,"Time to collect our prize."
4345,False,"I daresay they've had their fill of sport."
4346,False,"Is... Is it over?"
4347,False,"Their mastery over glamours is truly astounding."
4348,False,"It was no less than what<hex:02100103>I expected, but─well done."
4349,False,"Alisaie..."
4350,False,"Rest well..."
4351,False,"A Lightwarden, gone.<hex:02100103>I can scarce believe it."
4352,False,"Good. Keep that<hex:02100103>memory with you."
4353,False,"That Lightwarden...<hex:02100103>That was <hex:021A020203>terrifying<hex:021A020103>."
4354,False,"And thus doth the night return."
4355,False,"So the Warden of the wood falls."
4356,False,"We've taken back the darkness!"
4357,False,"At last."
4358,False,"It seems that Ryne was correct."
4359,False,"Thank goodness we succeeded."
4360,False,"That was a passing<hex:02100103>strange form for an eater."
4361,False,"Are you at all injured?"
4362,False,"Vauthry awaits."
4363,False,"It's the moment of truth."
4364,False,"No eaters remain to<hex:02100103>stand in our way."
4365,False,"I feel it above─<hex:02100103>a powerful light."
4366,False,"All has gone to plan thus far.<hex:02100103>...To the extent there <hex:021A020203>is<hex:021A020103> a plan."
4367,False,"An eater that only makes<hex:02100103>the others fiercer. Lovely."
4368,False,"We shall not falter!"
4369,False,"Not for despair, nor fate itself."
4370,False,"Be on your guard.<hex:02100103>This is wholly his realm."
4371,False,"<hex:021A020203>Where<hex:021A020103> is Emet-Selch?"
4372,False,"This is it─the<hex:02100103>first and final end."
4373,False,"The unwinding of life itself..."
4374,False,"One cannot help but pity Vauthry..."
4375,False,"Finally, all the Lightwardens are gone..."
4376,False,"Come out, come out, wherever you are!"
4377,False,"What should we do when we find them?"
4378,False,"We send them flying! Tee hee!"
4379,False,"Aaany moment now..."
4380,False,"D-Don't let them eat me!"
4381,False,"What in the world...?"
4382,False,"What's wrong with everyone? "
4383,False,"Where...where am I?"
4384,False,"Ungh... My head..."
4385,False,"Long live...Lord Vauthry?"
4386,False,"It was awful... <sob>"
4387,False,"Are you all right?"
4388,False,"Zzzzzz..."
4389,False,"<snore> <snore>"
4390,False,"<slurp> <snort>"
4391,False,"Wake up, damn you!"
4392,False,"What's happening!?"
4393,False,"It's the dust! Don't breathe in the dust!"
4394,False,"Keep an eye on them buggers!"
4395,False,"We're gonna need more meat..."
4396,False,"Who's a pretty girl, then?"
4397,False,"I think...<hic>...I've had enough..."
4398,False,"Whisk, whisk until it's mixed!♪"
4399,False,"Grab a seat!<hex:02100103>...And a mug!"
4400,False,"You do too much..."
4401,False,"Ugh, I need a drink..."
4402,False,"Aye, that hits the spot!"
4403,False,"Lali-hooo!"
4404,False,"La... La...li...ho!"
4405,False,"Hup! Ha!"
4406,False,"No swivin' Goggs about, then?"
4407,False,"B-Blast! It's higher than I thought..."
4408,False,"No rips that I can see..."
4409,False,"Heading in for a pint?"
4410,False,"We've got to protect our food stores!"
4411,False,"Is there aught else you need?"
4412,False,"I'm fine for now, thanks."
4413,False,"Just a few more rows!"
4414,False,"Hey! We're meant to do our chores first!"
4415,False,"Wait!"
4416,False,"I'm gonna get you!"
4417,False,"Yay! I got you!"
4418,False,"Nuh-uh! I let you catch me!"
4419,False,"That's enough! You're <hex:021A020203>both<hex:021A020103> winners."
4420,False,"Let's play catch-the-kitten!"
4421,False,"All right, you go first!"
4422,False,"This way, slowpoke!"
4423,False,"Almost time to eat!"
4424,False,"W-We'll get you some medicine..."
4425,False,"It's gotta be cooked by now..."
4426,False,"Did you hear what happened to that girl!?"
4427,False,"That ought to keep the wind out."
4428,False,"Please...<hex:02100103>Whatever you can spare..."
4429,False,"Maybe I should join him..."
4430,False,"But the letter from the Crystarium said..."
4431,False,"I hope this crop turns out better than the last..."
4432,False,"Don't you wag your finger at me!"
4433,False,"I once knew twins who had hair just like yours!"
4434,False,"We'd best scout the area first."
4435,False,"You can cross that bridge when you come to it."
4436,False,"The forest calls to me..."
4437,False,"I am not lying! I saw it!"
4438,False,"Well, if the others don't get here soon, we'll have to eat their share!"
4439,False,"Give me a moment, would you? I'm sure it's crooked!"
4440,False,"That is what Uimet said, anyway."
4441,False,"It is probably true, in that case."
4442,False,"Is everything ready?"
4443,False,"Master Lanille has taken care of it."
4444,False,"Then I shall return to my post."
4445,False,"I'd better count them again, just to be sure."
4446,False,"Yes, yes! Adorable!"
4447,False,"There must be at least one shiny here!"
4448,False,"Not a bad price, all things considered."
4449,False,"I'll get us a good deal, don't you worry!"
4450,False,"Now, you stay right there!"
4451,False,"Hmm? Where did it go?"
4452,False,"I take my eyes off of it for one moment..."
4453,False,"Come back here!"
4454,False,"Not again!"
4455,False,"Not good, not good..."
4456,False,"There it is!"
4457,False,"You must not wander off like that, understood?"
4458,False,"That's a fair point..."
4459,False,"I have a feeling I've forgotten something."
4460,False,"Come now, you mustn't fret."
4461,False,"It never ceases to amaze.<hex:02100103>Every time I see it..."
4462,False,"What am I supposed to do now!?"
4463,False,"A tasty morsel of information, yes?"
4464,False,"Leave no stone unturned..."
4465,False,"To see a sin eater from so close... I will never forget it."
4466,False,"And we'll split the profits!"
4467,False,"Yes, it's all here, as agreed."
4468,False,"So, ready to get back to work?"
4469,False,"Not yet. Still coughing up grey phlegm."
4470,False,"Erm... You might wanna get that looked at..."
4471,False,"The Fuath are nothing but trouble!"
4472,False,"As my master always used to say..."
4473,False,"Yes, better than boiling them, methinks."
4474,False,"A fair trade, it would seem."
4475,False,"A bit on the small side, perhaps..."
4476,False,"Slowly but surely do the mushrooms grow."
4477,False,"The blue one... Or the other blue one... Hmm..."
4478,False,"I am sure my eyesight is getting worse."
4479,False,"Oh! This is a heavy one!"
4480,False,"Gather round, little ones."
4481,False,"And we'll call it “Delta Attack!”"
4482,False,"Let's try shapechanging!"
4483,False,"That sounds like fun!"
4484,False,"Watch this!"
4485,False,"Ooh! I can't wait to see this!"
4486,False,"Piff, paff, poff!"
4487,False,"Eek!"
4488,False,"Oink!"
4489,False,"Hee hee! How terribly amusing!"
4490,False,"Haha! A porxie!"
4491,False,"Oink! Oink!"
4492,False,"Now I just need to work out how to reverse it..."
4493,False,"Wait for me!"
4494,False,"Come back!"
4495,False,"Ummm..."
4496,False,"It's a beaver!"
4497,False,"Snook!"
4498,False,"You'll never catch me!"
4499,False,"Snook! Chit!"
4500,False,"I wonder who pushed up <hex:021A020203>these<hex:021A020103> daisies?"
4501,False,"If I eat the whole thing, I shall go “pop!”"
4502,False,"All this frolicking has worn me out..."
4503,False,"Haven't you had enough!?"
4504,False,"Come on, lazy bones! There's frolicking to be done!"
4505,False,"So soft... So fluffy..."
4506,False,"No one can fly higher than meee～♪"
4507,False,"Now you see me, now you don't!"
4508,False,"Found me again! I'll have to try harder!"
4509,False,"Very good! Let's see if you can find me again!"
4510,False,"Ooh! You won't be so lucky next time!"
4511,False,"You're fun! Bye for now!"
4512,False,"Come now, don't sulk! Here, I brought you a flower!"
4513,False,"You're like a walking cloud!"
4514,False,"And they'll never suspect a thing!"
4515,False,"Hurry up and grow!"
4516,False,"Please, anything you can spare!"
4517,False,"That's what you get for pushing your luck!"
4518,False,"Nana nana nana nana, fishing!"
4519,False,"A steal at half the price!"
4520,False,"My fortune is just a few scoops of dirt away!"
4521,False,"As soon as his back's turned, that soup is mine!"
4522,False,"Next time, I'll set the line a bit lower."
4523,False,"Why must there be so many rules?"
4524,False,"I hope I haven't forgotten anything."
4525,False,"Why are they eating pebbles?"
4526,False,"Oh no! It looks like I've burnt it!"
4527,False,"He's gonna eat his face off! I can't wait!"
4528,False,"Go for the ribs! Don't let that bastard breathe!"
4529,False,"One good gust of wind, and the whole thing'll come down."
4530,False,"Maybe it's time to flip them over?"
4531,False,"Take that, you bastard nail! And that!"
4532,False,"This burgling lark's harder than I thought!"
4533,False,"If I stay drunk, I'll never get hungover!"
4534,False,"Stick to the plan, and we can't fail!"
4535,False,"Why must this take so long?"
4536,False,"They're sure to be impressed by my posing!"
4537,False,"Maybe I should draw the curtain..."
4538,False,"Be a good boy and fetch me some wine, would you?"
4539,False,"Yes, milady."
4540,False,"I had hoped there would be something in the Buttress to entertain me..."
4541,False,"...but it seems I was mistaken."
4542,False,"Back to the Understory it is."
4543,False,"Your wine, milady."
4544,False,"Tsk! That bloody fickle cow!"
4545,False,"""Where? Up your arse and 'round the corner!“ Ha!"
4546,False,"I wish they'd make these eyeholes a bit bigger."
4547,False,"Time for a stroll..."
4548,False,"...to the parlor!"
4549,False,"And then the wretched pauper split his head open! Hilarious!"
4550,False,"It's my money, and I'll spend it how I please!"
4551,False,"But, of courshe─hic!─the eldersh musht never know of thish!"
4552,False,"Oh, don't you worry about that, my friend!"
4553,False,"Haha! How very unlike you, Oboro!"
4554,False,"Hic! Perhapsh I have partaken a bit more than─hic─ushual..."
4555,False,"I tire of this place. Come."
4556,False,"Yes, my lady."
4557,False,"How frightfully vulgar!"
4558,False,"I quite agree."
4559,False,"Silence! When I want your opinion, I will ask for it!"
4560,False,"Yes, my lady!"
4561,False,"What I would not give for some stimulating conversation..."
4562,False,"One day, I shall buy this plaza and decorate in the manner of my choosing."
4563,False,"Yes, my lady..."
4564,False,"Care for a drink, sir?"
4565,False,"Can you not see I am busy!?"
4566,False,"I can't even give this stuff away..."
4567,False,"Why will no one take a drink?"
4568,False,"Maybe you should be more assertive?"
4569,False,"All right, I'll try."
4570,False,"Are you sure we haven't got anything better?"
4571,False,"Marry me, and you shall have everything you could wish for!"
4572,False,"It's about time I changed the string."
4573,False,"Oh my! How did you get so dusty?"
4574,False,"All right, you've made your point!"
4575,False,"I'd stick to the path if I were you."
4576,False,"But I'm ready for the front line!"
4577,False,"This ought to last us a while."
4578,False,"I'll work off this beer belly eventually!"
4579,False,"There'll be no trouble, I swear!"
4580,False,"There's something down there, I know it!"
4581,False,"Whoever built this thing must've been in a hurry."
4582,False,"Nothing to report!"
4583,False,"You'd better do one more circuit, just to be sure."
4584,False,"Yes, yes... I know how to do my job, thanks."
4585,False,"Soon, my pretty, soon..."
4586,False,"I could put one in that smug prick's back from up here. He wouldn't even know what hit him..."
4587,False,"And we even managed to get the best room they have!"
4588,False,"We should get away like this more often."
4589,False,"What could you have been doing to end up in such a state?"
4590,False,"Yes, but I hear enormous swords are all the rage!"
4591,False,"I want to see those noses touch the ground!"
4592,False,"If we pull this off, we'll make a killing!"
4593,False,"I swear my eyesight's getting worse..."
4594,False,"If I see you sleeping on the job again, you'll be on latrine duty until I say you've had enough!"
4595,False,"I have a feeling I'm in the wrong place..."
4596,False,"These feathers would fetch a gil or two..."
4597,False,"<pant> <pant>"
4598,False,"This is madness..."
4599,False,"Wh-What do we do...?"
4600,False,"Aaah!"
4601,False,"Shall we?"
4602,False,"Lead the way."
4603,False,"And here we have the Rotunda."
4604,False,"Watering, watering, all day long! "
4605,False,"All finished!"
4606,False,"Good work."
4607,False,"Here's the next batch."
4608,False,"So, I should scatter these in the same place."
4609,False,"That's right!"
4610,False,"And what comes after that?"
4611,False,"Yes, four apples, seven lemons. How many times must you count them!?"
4612,False,"My achin' bones..."
4613,False,"If I stare at those crates long enough, maybe they will move themselves."
4614,False,"Marvelous! Splendid!"
4615,False,"I fear this disagrees with my aesthetic sensibilities..."
4616,False,"This one might do..."
4617,False,"So? Find anything?"
4618,False,"I did indeed!"
4619,False,"And the reward is not bad either!"
4620,False,"Such vibrant colors!"
4621,False,"Where could it have gone?"
4622,False,"I'm sure it wouldn't sprout legs and walk off by itself."
4623,False,"Perhaps it found its way over here?"
4624,False,"Or perhaps not."
4625,False,"Maybe it's lurking in here?"
4626,False,"I do not see that posing any difficulties."
4627,False,"“By the time you read this, I shall surely be...”"
4628,False,"Well, perhaps if you'd brushed your hair away from your eyes, you'd have seen it!"
4629,False,"I should take another look, just in case."
4630,False,"But that would mean that cucumbers are fruit..."
4631,False,"We're still waiting for those new ladders to be delivered, I'm afraid."
4632,False,"“...and ripped out his still-beating heart...”"
4633,False,"I can never find what I'm looking for."
4634,False,"Something about needles and haystacks springs to mind..."
4635,False,"Would it kill them to organize things a bit better?"
4636,False,"Who needs ladders when you have magic!"
4637,False,"So, where is it?"
4638,False,"Erm..."
4639,False,"I didn't ask for an “erm,” did I?"
4640,False,"It should be ready soon."
4641,False,"Any idea how soon?"
4642,False,"I'm afraid not."
4643,False,"Hopefully it won't explode this time..."
4644,False,"Sir, yes, sir!"
4645,False,"You call that a squat!?"
4646,False,"Is everything here yet?"
4647,False,"How goes it?"
4648,False,"Well, it could be worse!"
4649,False,"Don't be afraid to ask for help if you need it."
4650,False,"Understood!"
4651,False,"Maybe I should lighten the load..."
4652,False,"I concur."
4653,False,"Well, there goes my lunch..."
4654,False,"Take it or leave it!"
4655,False,"I wonder what the problem is..."
4656,False,"I'd best make a note of this."
4657,False,"Everything seems fine here."
4658,False,"Not great, but acceptable."

4667,False,"We have every garment the discerning professional could possibly need!"
4668,False,"It will make a fine gift."
4669,False,"What could possibly go wrong?"
4670,False,"You certainly have an eye for quality!"
4671,False,"Stop whining!"
4672,False,"I'll show her! I can live on stolen bread!"
4673,False,"Think of the profits we'll make!"
4674,False,"So she told him to take a long walk off a short pier!"
4675,False,"I shall leave it to the chef's discretion."
4676,False,"It all seems in order."
4677,False,"Thank you for keeping an eye on it!"
4678,False,"Don't mention it!"
4679,False,"Hmm... No leaks, no strange noises..."
4680,False,"What say you? Are you in?"
4681,False,"It might be easier to shoot them down with my bow."

4712,False,"Where to put this...?"
4713,False,"I'm all for people having fun, but can't they learn to pick up after themselves?"
4714,False,"It's a mess, all right. But it could have been worse."
4715,False,"Look what I found!"
4716,False,"We have to clean up this mess before Master Gegeruju sees it..."
4717,False,"Even pirates clean up better than this!"
4718,False,"At least all the squatting I'm doing is good for my thighs..."
4719,False,"My muscles shine even brighter on these sparkling sands!"
4720,False,"As if it weren't bad enough already, the debris keeps floating in..."
4721,False,"We need to clean up before the Rising! Or wait, has it already started?"
4722,False,"It's a hassle, all right, but we can't just leave this trash here..."
4723,False,"Is that the last of it?"
4724,False,"Where do empty bottles go again...?"
4725,False,"All that digging makes me sleepy!"

4735,False,"How am I supposed to get up <hex:021A020203>there<hex:021A020103>!?"
4736,False,"Hah! Getting to the top is child's play!"
4737,False,"Phew! Almost there!"
4738,False,"I don't have the nerve to try myself, but I do enjoy watching!"
4739,False,"They really saved the best for last..."
4740,False,"I know you can do it!"
4741,False,"What's most important is that you have fun!"
4742,False,"What are you waiting for!? Give it a try!"
4743,False,"Only way to get there is from above, it seems."
4744,False,"Look! It's a slide!"
4745,False,"You're going to climb up there? That looks so scary!"
4746,False,"I hear there's a nice place to rest there!"
4747,False,"Ooh, look at those muscular thighs!"
4748,False,"Muscle-heads? Love 'em!"

4754,False,"I'm going to make it this time!"
4755,False,"Urgh..."
4756,False,"Shall we dance?"
4757,False,"A-one, and a-two, and a-one, and a-two!"

4759,False,"They have the battered fish again this year!"
4760,False,"Ooh! Let's get some and eat it on the beach!"
4761,False,"The wind calls us. Run as fast as your legs carry you and soar into the air."
4762,False,"There's no festival fairer than the Moonfire Faire!"
4763,False,"I can't wait to write a story about this!"
4764,False,"You did it! Congratulations!"

4774,False,"Heat-resistant garb? Well, well, I would like to try making that!"
4775,False,"I do wish those ladies would be quiet. They're scaring all the fish away."
4776,False,"This bleedin' lout keeps catchin' my godsdamned fish before I can!"
4777,False,"Hah! As easy as baking pineapple pie, I say!"

4793,False,"No! Up the stairs, I said!"
4794,False,"Straight ahead, right, miss?"

4800,False,"Relax, he'll find his way back."
4801,False,"Sir, one of the workers has disappeared!"
4802,False,"Stay sharp! The briefest lapse in concentration can have lasting consequences!"
4803,False,"I've been searching high and low for you!"
4804,False,"Sorry, miss... I got a little spun around..."
4805,False,"Concerted works starting soon."
4806,False,"Let's show 'em what we can do."

4814,False,"Zzzzzz..."
4815,False,"(Don't make a sound! They've fallen asleep!)"
4816,False,"Come on, you can do it!"

4822,False,"Put that book away and come play!"
4823,False,"Let me finish this page, all right?"
4824,False,"Perhaps we can give her a little push, tee hee!"
4825,False,"A rainbow! It's so beautiful!"
4826,False,"I wish Mummy could see this too!"
4827,False,"Do you think we can walk on it?"

4860,False,"Relax, darling, you're doing fine."
4861,False,"If this is a dream, I hope to never wake."
4862,False,"Aren't you glad we came?"
4863,False,"Hm? Who is that?"
4864,False,"A guest of His Majesty?"
4865,False,"Will His Majesty be joining us?"
4866,False,"I cannot dance another step. A moment, I prithee..."
4867,False,"If there is aught you require, pray do not hesitate to ask."
4868,False,"Go ahead, eat until you're fit to burst!"
4869,False,"Well, if you put your mind to it, you could turn into a big tree yourself!"
4870,False,"I wish I was as big as that tree!"
4871,False,"If we use those big mushrooms, we can reach the top!"
4872,False,"And there might even be hidden treasure!"
4873,False,"Last one there's a rotten egg!"
4874,False,"Trickle, trickle! Splishy splash!"
4875,False,"Those horrid Fuath can't spoil our fun here!"
4876,False,"Would you like me to give you a push?"
4877,False,"Oh... It's a bit steep, isn't it?"
4878,False,"You were as quick as lightning!"
4879,False,"Did you see how fast I went?"
4880,False,"Let's do that again!"
4881,False,"See you at the top!"
4882,False,"We should make a bridge!"
4883,False,"All the colors of the rainbow!"
4884,False,"Look at all this space! Think of the possibilities!"
4885,False,"Let's make a big tower for the children to climb!"
4886,False,"And then they can fly from the top! Tee hee!"
4887,False,"Waterfalls are nice and all, but something is missing..."
4888,False,"What about something slippy? Or something slidey?"
4889,False,"We should host a tea party!"
4890,False,"With lots of delicious cakes!"
4891,False,"Or even better, a whole house made of sweets!"
4892,False,"They obey my every command..."
4893,False,"Would that my last partner could dance so well."
4894,False,"<hex:022C0DFF07><hex:022903EB0203><hex:FF02> <hex:0203>, so good of you to visit!"
4895,False,"Please have lots of fun!"
4896,False,"The children just love to lie in these and swing away."
4897,False,"Swinging on the wind, side and side again."
4898,False,"To their hearts' content!"
4899,False,"Fa la la la la.♪"
4900,False,"Enterprise...engage!"
4901,False,"Hm? What's an enterprise?"
4902,False,"I've no idea. I just heard someone say it."
4903,False,"Oh? I guess I'll say it too, then."
4904,False,"Enterprise...engage!"
4905,False,"Heh, that was strangely fun!"
4906,False,"I know, right!?"
4907,False,"I like flowers. They look pretty and smell nice."
4908,False,"Don't they, though?"
4909,False,"Do you know what this creature is?"
4910,False,"No. Wasn't there something like it in Lydha Lran?"
4911,False,"Right. It's called a moogle."
4912,False,"Moogle... And what's that peculiar thing attached to its head?"
4913,False,"That's a pom-pom, and they say that real ones glow!"
4914,False,"They glow? Really?"
4915,False,"I want one!"
4916,False,"Does it come off the moogle, do you think?"
4917,False,"If you pull hard enough, sure!"
4918,False,"Great! Let's collect lots and decorate with them!"
4919,False,"Phew. I'm glad for that to be over and done with."
4920,False,"We'd best leave the negotiations to Alphinaud and the Exarch."
4921,False,"Perhaps now we have afforded ourselves an audience."
4922,False,"Now they have little choice but to hear our plea."
4923,False,"So, what kind of dream should we spin next?"
4924,False,"I'm not sure. What do you think?"
4925,False,"Hmmm..."
4926,False,"How about...a great big sheep?"
4927,False,"With all the milk it gives us, we could make a milk fountain!"
4928,False,"Imagine it─we could drink and play at the same time!"
4929,False,"Oh, that sounds wonderful!"
4930,False,"Let's make lots of big sheep and drown all of Lyhe Mheg in milk!"
4931,False,"Uh... We're going to need to have a little talk..."
4932,False,"How about...a great big beast?"
4933,False,"Something that's a natural predator to the you-know-whats!"
4934,False,"Speaking of which...did you make cookies in their likeness?"
4935,False,"I did. Should I not have?"
4936,False,"I've been seeing them a lot outside, so I thought I'd try my hand..."
4937,False,""
4938,False,""

4943,False,"Curses. It's not alone."
4944,False,"Calm yourself, old boy. Everything will be fine."

4953,False,"I can just feel inspiration about to strike..."
4954,False,"Who has time for ardor and affection? We have a job to do..."
4955,False,"This is an unusual color to see at this time of year..."
4956,False,"Cheer up, won't you? Things will go better next time. I'm sure of it!"

4984,False,"Huh? Where did I put that nail?"
4985,False,"Do you have enough hands?"
4986,False,"Aye, we're good here."

4988,False,"I don't know much about braziers, but I know what I like."
4989,False,"I'll be careful, Chief!"
4990,False,"A fine feeling watching the place transform."
4991,False,"There's still a long way to go, but we'll get there."

5005,False,"Never fails to take your breath away, does it?"
5006,False,"I'd best write today's log before I forget..."
5007,False,"It's hard to keep a steady hand when the ocean's beauty is distracting me."
5008,False,"I must record every detail of the day's weather conditions. Tedious work, but it must be done. "
5009,False,"Get your rods ready─here comes enough fish for the lot of you!"
5010,False,"And we're here! Time to fish!"
5011,False,"Looks like handsome hauls all around!"

5013,False,"There's no mistaking this light─we've found ourselves a spectral current!"
5014,False,"Ain't got no need for small fry, so I throw 'em right back to the sea."
5015,False,"Ye ain't gotta see a fish to know its size! Mark well how long it takes to bite, and how fiercely it pulls."
5016,False,"An expert angler's got two qualities: patience and a discernin' eye. Don't waste time pullin' minnows outta the sea."
5017,False,"One cast, one catch!"
5018,False,"To catch a fish that's bein' conservative with its bites, you'll need to use your precision hookset."
5019,False,"If a fish is pullin' with the strength of an aurochs, you'll need a powerful hookset to match it."
5020,False,"If ye wanna get straight to fishin', spread some chum in the water and watch the fish crowd around!"
5021,False,"Now do some fishin' of yer own!"

5412,False,"All shark and no bite, hah!"
5413,False,"Ah, save me! Hold me!"
5414,False,"I've been waiting for this day all year!"
5415,False,"She's the belle of the beach!"
5416,False,"This summer will be even better than the last!"
5417,False,"It seems awfully complicated..."
5418,False,"The beach is the battlefield today, eh?"
5419,False,"Oh, what I wouldn't give to be a dancer too..."
5420,False,"If things're lookin' grim, I'll jump to your rescue!"
5421,False,"Now where's this so-called monster? I'm sure it's not so tough."
5422,False,"Legs!? It has legs!?"
5423,False,"Oh, I just want to snuggle it!"
5424,False,"Dance truly is a salve for the soul."
5425,False,"This dance will keep me and mine safe!"
5426,False,"The more the merrier!"
5427,False,"Not a pixie in sight. Thought they'd play a trick on us by now."
5428,False,"Aye. Wonder where they've all gotten to..."
5429,False,"Aye. All I see is that peculiar creature there..."
5430,False,"Can't put my finger on it, but something doesn't feel right..."
5431,False,"Let's report back for the time being."
5432,False,"We've brought what you asked."
5433,False,"Ooh, let me see! Let me see!"
5434,False,"Yes, not a one more or less than requested! Many thanks!"
5435,False,"Great. We'll be on our way, then."
5436,False,"Whew, I'm glad that went well."
5437,False,"Aye, get the amount wrong and they'll fair bite your head off..."
5438,False,"Well, that was a waste of a trip."
5439,False,"Bah, when they told us we could trade the stones here..."
5440,False,"They could've mentioned they don't deal in trifling quantities."
5441,False,"That'll teach us to do our due diligence and check."
5442,False,"Nothing for it but to go and gather some more."
5443,False,"Huzzah, the exit! Safe at last!"
5444,False,"My thanks for your kind aid!"
5445,False,"Don't mention it. Just glad to be of help."
5446,False,"No, no, I must thank you properly. Come with me to Mord Souq!"
5447,False,"We shall have a feast! Yes, a feast with our finest delacies!"
5448,False,"Oho, we won't say no to that! Right, Theyler?"
5449,False,"Hm, must say I'm curious about the local cuisine..."
5450,False,"All we can do is hope for the best."
5451,False,"People made this!? With those fleshy stumps?"
5452,False,"They may be fleshy, but they are nimble, and ambitious besides."
5453,False,"The Sea of Clouds! Have you ever been?"
5454,False,"What is your home called?"
5455,False,"Wait... Where am I?"
5456,False,"I've come to give my regards to Ehll Tou, but I seem to have lost my way..."
5457,False,"Many thanks! It's so easy to lose your way here."
5458,False,"Maybe I can help. Who are you looking for?"
5459,False,"Ah, I know her! Everyone around here does. Climb these stairs and you should spot her before long."
5460,False,"There shouldn't be any sharks on these shores, especially not so close..."
5461,False,"The next big win is mine, I can feel it!"
5462,False,"My “Dawn Deck” will be unstoppable!"
5463,False,"Prepare to feel my fist of rage!"
5464,False,"Oh, calm down, Ulala..."
5465,False,"You've the worst mahjong face, my friend..."
5466,False,"Hmm, what should I do now...?"
5467,False,"<gasp> The size of this place!"
5468,False,"Where shall we start!?"
5469,False,"Just one more try..."
5470,False,"What, again!?"
5471,False,"There's a time for soldierin' and there's a time for loafin'."
5472,False,"Take care not to spend too much time in the sun."
5473,False,"We simply must introduce this dance in Coerthas, if only to bring a mote of summer's warmth with us."
5474,False,"So this is what an eternal summer feels like..."
5475,False,"I've never felt more alive!"
5476,False,"Good luck getting me to leave!"
5477,False,"It's so hot... Perhaps if I doffed my armor..."
5478,False,"Come on, get in the water!"
5479,False,"I don't ever want this celebration to end..."
5480,False,"Do you hear me!? I don't want to see a one of you slacking!"
5481,False,"My arm feels like it's about to fall off..."
5482,False,"Let's do this!"
5483,False,"Leave it to me."
5484,False,"I'll do the heavy lifting!"
5485,False,"Take that! And that!"
5486,False,"Steady the hips...and swing!"
5487,False,"Yes, this is quite an inspiring scene."
5488,False,"Just look at those bulging biceps..."
5489,False,"Keep at that same spot!"
5490,False,"Not half bad, I say."
5491,False,"My sides are achin' somethin' fierce..."
5492,False,"How's it lookin'?"
5493,False,"You got it, Chief!"
5494,False,"Ungh!"
5495,False,"Finally figured out how to use that pickaxe, I see."
5496,False,"How about you try your hand with a hammer next?"
5497,False,"Aye aye, Chief!"
5498,False,"Thank ye kindly!"
5499,False,"Pound! Smash! Crash!"
5500,False,"Hyah!"
5501,False,"Let me show you how it's done."
5502,False,"You lift the hammer like this, then...yah!"
5503,False,"Aha...so the secret's to take a running start!"
5504,False,"Phew! I need a rest..."
5505,False,"We should check on the others' progress."
5506,False,"Sounds like a plan!"
5507,False,"Is that blood? Am I bleeding!? Oh, the pain!"
5508,False,"Do you require more supplies?"
5509,False,"Progress report! And be quick about it!"
5510,False,"Are you sure that isn't upside down?"
5511,False,"Mustn't forget to take inventory..."
5512,False,"Hm? What curious foreign tongue is this?"
5513,False,"This should suffice for the time being, Chief."
5514,False,"That scaffold looks awfully wobbly..."
5515,False,"Right on schedule, Chief!"
5516,False,"Now, what do we need here...?"
5517,False,"I'll see that we're all stocked up!"
5518,False,"Those are for repairing the rooves. And these..."
5519,False,"This stone should serve us well."
5520,False,"Let's see. We still need to stock up on..."
5521,False,"Excellent. No delays here."
5522,False,"Now, what tasks remain undone?"
5523,False,"My stonemasonry skills will do Ishgard proud!"
5524,False,"This, too, would make for a stirring painting..."
5525,False,"I'll prepare a copy of the construction schedule for you."
5526,False,"Only the finest materials will do!"
5527,False,"Get a hold of yourself, damn it! It's a long way down!"
5528,False,"This should serve nicely for the floor."
5529,False,"This is so easy, I could do it with my eyes clo─<hex:02100103>OWWW!"
5530,False,"You must hone your eye for stone."
5531,False,"Don't forget to haul the materials in the proper order!"
5532,False,"The slightest chip or crack could send the walls crashing down."
5533,False,"Yes, this should suffice..."
5534,False,"Let me take another look..."
5535,False,"I'll do my best!"
5536,False,"Aye aye, Chief!"
5537,False,"We'll be needing extra hands for this."
5538,False,"Watch out for your hand!"
5539,False,"Maybe carpentry isn't for you..."
5540,False,"There's no need to rush, you know."
5541,False,"To build a strong foundation, every nail counts..."
5542,False,"I think I've finally got the hang of─<hex:02100103>OWWW!"
5543,False,"A little tap here, and a little tap there..."
5544,False,"If only I weren't so clumsy..."
5545,False,"How majestic!"
5546,False,"Such beautiful stone!"
5547,False,"Are you certain we have enough materials?"
5548,False,"Your thoroughness is admirable..."
5549,False,"I'm prone to mistakes─that's why I always check thrice!"
5550,False,"You'll find no better stone in all of Eorzea!"
5551,False,"Fifty-one, fifty-two, fifty─wait, did I count that one twice?"
5552,False,"If I just stack these here..."
5553,False,"This should do!"
5554,False,"Oho! Looking good, indeed!"
5555,False,"Steady now..."
5556,False,"Sigh... Why doesn't she ever notice me?"
5557,False,"Watch out for the thumb...watch out for the─<hex:02100103>OWWW!"
5558,False,"Heh! Lookin' good, eh?"
5559,False,"Fastest hammer in Ishgard, I tell you!"
5560,False,"Eat up! You'll need all the strength you can muster for the next shift!"
5561,False,"Saint Reymanaud's Cathedral wasn't built on an empty stomach, you know."
5562,False,"I'm going to feel this tomorrow..."
5563,False,"Time to work off that last flagon of ale!"
5564,False,"Unnngaaah!"
5565,False,"Nnngraaaaaah!"
5566,False,"It's all in the hips...hyaaah!"
5567,False,"Right! I'll tell the others."
5568,False,"...And that's what's on the agenda for tomorrow."
5569,False,"Hoooh! Haaah! Hoooh! Haaah!"
5570,False,"It just won't break. Am I not doing this right?"
5571,False,"Why won't anyone look at <hex:021A020203>me<hex:021A020103>!?"
5572,False,"How do you even lift that thing?"
5573,False,"Not easily, I'll tell you that..."
5574,False,"Let me guess...is it pineapple!?"
5575,False,"The chef told me the secret ingredient in the stew..."
5576,False,"This shall be the scene for my next masterpiece!"
5577,False,"Restoring such a mighty structure will be no small task...!"
5578,False,"The smashing's over! It's repairing time!"
5579,False,"The damage here is even worse than I thought..."
5580,False,"What do I get to smash next!?"
5581,False,"Can this truly be restored to its former glory?"
5582,False,"You're an inspiration to us all, Chief..."
5583,False,"Getting the stairwells just right is tricky, I hear..."
5584,False,"There's nothing my muscles can't overcome!"
5585,False,"Ngggaaaaaahhh!"
5586,False,"Yaaaaaahhh!"
5587,False,"It's all in the hips, they say!"
5588,False,"Next up is..."
5589,False,"Aye, this should serve nicely!"
5590,False,"Everything appears in good order..."
5591,False,"Isn't it impressive?"
5592,False,"Look at the size of this one!"
5593,False,"That should do."
5594,False,"Take care not to fall!"
5595,False,"You're quite dedicated, aren't you?"
5596,False,"A masterpiece shall be wrought..."
5597,False,"This is almost fun!"
5598,False,"I must do Ishgard proud with my stonework..."
5599,False,"Whatever you say, Chief!"
5600,False,"All stocked up!"
5601,False,"Hm? Did I miscount?"
5602,False,"Just like clockwork!"
5603,False,"Now where did I leave my hammer?"
5604,False,"A solid base if I ever saw one."
5605,False,"Looking good, I'd say."
5606,False,"How goes it?"
5607,False,"This is the final push!"
5608,False,"Do you know a good chirurgeon? My back is killing me..."
5609,False,"That's why I told you to lift with your legs..."
5610,False,"Looking better and better!"
5611,False,"And that should do it!"
5612,False,"Isn't she a beauty?"
5613,False,"Ooh! I want to fly in that!"
5614,False,"Is it done yet?"
5615,False,"I'd say you've earned yourselves a break."
5616,False,"Rest up well, for there's still work to be done!"
5617,False,"With a bit more muscle, maybe I'd be better at this..."
5618,False,"Your biceps! They cry out in pain!"
5619,False,"This wall appears to have escaped the war unscathed..."
5620,False,"I'll place an order. How many?"
5621,False,"We'll be needing more pickaxes."
5622,False,"Fine material, this!"
5623,False,"I must take inventory and report back quickly..."
5624,False,"...Ahhhhhh! Working so hard, sometimes I forget to breathe!"
5625,False,"A sight to stir the heart and inspire me to the heights of creative genius!"
5626,False,"This one's sure to be his magnum opus!"
5627,False,"Why, it's lovely!"
5628,False,"Best rest up now before the test flight."
5629,False,"Yes, I could use a cup of piping hot tea."
5630,False,"They're gone! Now's our chance!"
5631,False,"Kweh! Kweh!♪"
5632,False,"Kweh..."
5633,False,"Would you sit down?"
5634,False,"How can I? I should be out there, cutting down imperials!"
5635,False,"It is vital we overcome their advantage in numbers."
5636,False,"An advantage that keeps growing. Xeven's men were hit especially hard."
5637,False,"The enemy could launch a surprise attack at any moment, so be prepared!"
5638,False,"You'd be better off heading back to the infirmary and having that leg looked at."
5639,False,"But I can still fight!"
5640,False,"Most flattering... Ahem! For the sultana, that is."
5641,False,"Would that I could stay longer, but duty beckons..."
5642,False,"I remember it as though it were yesterday."
5643,False,"I fear the time has come for us to depart."
5644,False,"Does Philestiaux have any new tasks that need doing?"
5645,False,"Perhaps there are supplies that need procuring."
5646,False,"No good work ever got done on an empty stomach!"
5647,False,"I'd like nothing more than to go on a grand adventure!"
5648,False,"I've decided to return to Limsa. My beloved may be lost forever, but at least there I have memories..."
5649,False,"Look, we can use this stepladder!"
5650,False,"Hey, wait for me!"
5651,False,"W-Watch out!"
5652,False,"Are you sure this will suffice?"
5653,False,"Be sure to keep the inventory up to date."
5654,False,"You really have a way with that chisel, don't you?"
5655,False,"Hey, I'm no slouch myself!"
5656,False,"Heh! You're too kind, miss..."
5657,False,"This should do, Chief!"
5658,False,"One stone on top of the next..."
5659,False,"Leave it to me, Chief!"
5660,False,"The stairwell must be finished with all speed!"
5661,False,"One step at a time─Featherfall won't be built in a day!"
5662,False,"Good as done, Chief!"
5663,False,"This wall seems no worse for the wear..."
5664,False,"Cut, lay, fit, and repeat..."
5665,False,"Building a curved arch of stone is no small task!"
5666,False,"Perfection is ever elusive, but I am rather pleased with how this place turned out."
5667,False,"I'll study well, Chief!"
5668,False,"This magnificent window frame deserves only the finest glass...!"
5669,False,"Ishgardian architecture is truly the pride of the realm!"
5670,False,"The inclination of the slope is just as the chief calculated!"
5671,False,"Preposterous! Or is it...?"
5672,False,"They say the savior of Ishgard <hex:020815E905FF08>herself<hex:FF08>himself<hex:03> labors among us!"
5673,False,"How is it staying in the Hoarfrost?"
5674,False,"Why, I've never lived in such comfort!"
5675,False,"Oh, I've forgotten something again!"
5676,False,"Shhh! I'm trying to hide here!"
5677,False,"Where haven't I looked...?"
5678,False,"The captain runs a tight ship, to say the least..."
5679,False,"The freshest catches of the day, and exotic spices to season them! We have all you need!"
5680,False,"What shall we order from Maisenta?"
5681,False,"Mayhap some nuts and other fruits of the forest?"
5682,False,"By the Twelve, it's cold here! I can scarce feel my fingertips!"
5683,False,"Do any of our fine products catch your discerning eye?"
5684,False,"Good work, men!"
5685,False,"Get some rest! The next stage will be a demanding one."
5686,False,"Here's to a job well done!"
5687,False,"I could swear my biceps are bigger..."
5688,False,"My muscles haven't failed me yet!"
5689,False,"I knew I could count on you!"
5690,False,"Phew! That was the toughest job yet..."
5691,False,"My masterpiece is complete!"
5692,False,"Hey! What are you doing in there!?"
5693,False,"Get down at once─it's dangerous up there!"
5694,False,"Manacutter, full speed ahead! Whee!"
5695,False,"The adults are back! Let's get out of here!"
5696,False,"I'm sorry, mister!"
5697,False,"Practice the motion until it becomes second nature!"
5698,False,"Don't ask me! I don't know!"
5699,False,"You're always alone. Is something the matter?"
5700,False,"I lost my husband in the war..."
5701,False,"If there's anything I can do for you, just say the word!"
5702,False,"You're too kind..."
5703,False,"What in the─!? Noooooo!"
5704,False,"So this is the new branch of the manufactory..."
5705,False,"I can't wait to get to work!"
5706,False,"He's truly outdone himself this time."
5707,False,"Ishgard's not so bad...once you get used to the cold."
5708,False,"At least we won't lack for company."
5709,False,"Leave the cooking to me!"
5710,False,"And the manufactory's just a hop, skip, and jump away!"
5711,False,"It's the savior of Ishgard! In the flesh! Can I shake your hand?"
5712,False,"This is sure to win her heart!"
5713,False,"This should do it!"
5714,False,"The auger's store of aether is running low..."
5715,False,"The beaches are safe, for now... Let's hope that shark stays in the water where it belongs."
5716,False,"If any mean old sharks come ashore, Khloe will scare them away! Don't worry, Zhloe!"
5717,False,"Oh, you're Zhloe's personal hero!"
5718,False,"Now, let's go play on the beach!"
5719,False,"The emissaries never give up..."
5720,False,"And neither will I!"
5721,False,"You know, I'd love to perform here."
5722,False,"I could sing for my friends and family..."
5723,False,"I'll talk to the seneschal.<hex:02100103>He wouldn't dare say no!"
5724,False,"It's always so colorful!"
5725,False,"Did you see the costumes?"
5726,False,"For the Songbirds?<hex:02100103>Yes! Lisette did a fine job!"
5727,False,"Tra la la la la.♪"
5728,False,"Do doo da doo.♪"
5729,False,"La di da dah.♪"
5730,False,"Look! It's the Songbirds!"
5731,False,"Gosh, they're gorgeous!"
5732,False,"Shall we watch for a while?"
5733,False,"I suppose we should go..."
5734,False,"That was so much fun!"
5735,False,"It certainly was!"
5736,False,"I feel so close to Ulala!"
5737,False,"Now that you mention it..."
5738,False,"They do seem alike, kupo!"
5739,False,"Ulala! Over here!"
5740,False,"Narumi! My queen!"
5741,False,"Masha, I love you!"
5742,False,"I adore your outfits!"
5743,False,"The Songbirds are life!"
5744,False,"I wish we could talk to Elyne again."
5745,False,"And Kupka, too!"
5746,False,"Just a little more rest, then I can see the Songbirds!"
5747,False,"It's all so pretty!"
5748,False,"I wanted to help decorate..."
5749,False,"Oh my..."
5750,False,""
5751,False,""
5752,False,"Where... <pant> <pant> could she have gone?"
5753,False,"Which do you prefer, my dear?"
5754,False,"Oh, the one with the ribbon is just lovely!"
5755,False,"Stay focused, now."
5756,False,"Don't show any fear─they can smell it!"
5757,False,"Quite a fight she put up..."
5758,False,"Blood! Blood! Blood!"
5759,False,"One of you should take responsibility!"
5760,False,"Hurry up and punish somebody already."
5761,False,"I'm so tired of this."
5762,False,"I can't relax until we hang <hex:021A020203>someone<hex:021A020103> out to dry."
5763,False,"I haven't done anything...that you can prove."
5764,False,"I haven't slept in a week!"
5765,False,"Or twenty! Haha... Please help me."
5766,False,"Should have all the parts you need here."
5767,False,"The workshop seems so...peaceful."
5768,False,"Busy time?"
5769,False,"Seems like you could use a hand."
5770,False,"Perfect. I'll have a look."
5771,False,"Take a break! Relax!"
5772,False,"I can't believe we're working with Neillemard!"
5773,False,"More importantly, Nimie. Her eyes are so piercing... <sigh>"
5774,False,"True, but Denys is the gorgeous one..."
5775,False,"Wait, how long have we been out here?"
5776,False,"I could not have asked for a better present than spending the Starlight season with you!"
5777,False,"It's a miracle I was granted a respite from my duties."
5778,False,"Is it just me, or do things look particularly festive this year?"
5779,False,"We couldn't have done it without you."
5780,False,"See those decorations? They were all mine!"
5781,False,"They're beautiful! You truly have an eye for these things..."
5782,False,"We've got some new faces joining us today!"
5783,False,"Great! We could use the help!"
5784,False,"Rookies to boss around? All right!"
5785,False,"I'm with you, Chief!"
5786,False,"I'll put some muscle on you!"
5787,False,"Pray disregard my station. I will perform any task, and gladly."
5788,False,"Hyah!"
5789,False,"Can't help but feel I'm a bit rusty after all that time off..."
5790,False,"This thing is heavier than it looks..."
5791,False,"Ho!"
5792,False,"This city has so many more faces I must capture on canvas..."
5793,False,"Right back in the swing of things─just as I like to see it."
5794,False,"Have you ever lifted a pickaxe in your life?"
5795,False,"Good to be back on the job, Chief!"
5796,False,"I fear this is my first foray into manual labor..."
5797,False,"Let an expert show you how it's done!"
5798,False,"I thank you for your wisdom, my friend."
5799,False,"You have potential, I'll say that much."
5800,False,"Have to provide a good example for the newcomers!"
5801,False,"Yes, it's coming back to me now! It's all in the hips..."
5802,False,"Eyaaahhh!"
5803,False,"It's as hard as a... Well, I guess it is a rock."
5804,False,"All right! Which one of you dumped this rubbish here!?"
5805,False,"Now, now... Let's take a deep breath..."
5806,False,"How am I supposed to read these chocobo scratches!?"
5807,False,"Are you not, perchance, holding that backwards?"
5808,False,"Sixteen? Are you sure it wasn't eighteen?"
5809,False,"When in doubt, it never hurts to consult the skybuilders' board."
5810,False,"This is a vital task! Our inventory's not going to count itself."
5811,False,"Hey you! Up there! Don't forget to show the rookies how it's done!"
5812,False,"Keeping inventory may not be a glamorous task, but it's a necessary one."
5813,False,"Leave it to me, Chief!"
5814,False,"Consider it done, milo─er, Lord Chief."
5815,False,"We've got materials in spades, but we could use a few more hands."
5816,False,"Just leave it to me."
5817,False,"Let's see what else needs doing..."
5818,False,"I'll prepare it at once!"
5819,False,"I'd best place a new order before we run out of supplies..."
5820,False,"Report to me as soon as your task is done, you hear?"
5821,False,"Got it, Miss!"
5822,False,"How many times must I tell you to keep your eye on the nail!?"
5823,False,"Must keep focus... Must keep focus..."
5824,False,"Allow me to show you how it's─owww!"
5825,False,"Oh, dear... That couldn't have felt good..."
5826,False,"A tappity-tap here, a tappity-tap there..."
5827,False,"Am I doing this right?"
5828,False,"Looking good! Keep it up!"
5829,False,"I don't want to see a single bent nail! Understood?"
5830,False,"How's this, Chief?"
5831,False,"Looking rather sharp, if I do say so myself! Haha!"
5832,False,"Consider it done, Lord─er, Chief."
5833,False,"The masses may not appreciate it, but this will be my greatest masterpiece yet!"
5834,False,"Numbers aren't your strong suit, are they?"
5835,False,"Better safe than sorry..."
5836,False,"Seventy-one, seventy-two, seventy-four... Wait, where was I again?"
5837,False,"Pray forgive my impropriety, but mayhap you forgot seventy-three...?"
5838,False,"Sounds good to me!"
5839,False,"We have enough supplies here, yes?"
5840,False,"Shall I bring more from our reserves?"
5841,False,"Always good to see my skybuilders get into their work!"
5842,False,"Don't forget to rest up from time to time. We've a long way to go."
5843,False,"I learned it all from you, Chief!"
5844,False,"Now <hex:021A020203>that's<hex:021A020103> a generous donation! We'll put it to good use!"
5845,False,"You are far too kind, Chief..."

5847,False,"Have to set a good example for the newcomers...!"
5848,False,"It's all in the─ow! Okay, now that was an example of what <hex:021A020203>not<hex:021A020103> to do."
5849,False,"Shall I summon a healer?"
5850,False,"At this rate, I'm going to run out of nails..."
5851,False,"One task done, now it's on to the next..."
5852,False,"Your technique's improved, I see."
5853,False,"I reckon you're a natural at this."
5854,False,"Tap, tap, tappity-tap!"
5855,False,"This may very well be my best work yet!"
5856,False,"You flatter me overmuch, Chief..."
5857,False,"Don't look down. Don't look down. Don't look─damn it all!"
5858,False,"Just like that, now. Take it nice and easy."
5859,False,"Truth be told, I enjoy working in silence."
5860,False,"You'll want to climb up to make sure everything is in place."
5861,False,"I can see I still have much to learn from my seniors..."
5862,False,"Now you're talking. I'm famished!"
5863,False,"Shall we take a short respite?"
5864,False,"Your stamina has improved greatly. Consider me impressed."
5865,False,"Always remember: endurance is as important as technique─if not more so."
5866,False,"Thanks, Chief! I've trained hard for this day!"
5867,False,"I'd best take another look at the plans..."
5868,False,"Endurance indeed. I thank you for your wisdom, Chief."
5869,False,"Be careful now, will you!?"
5870,False,"I've never seen wood of such quality!"
5871,False,"I've got it down this time, I swear. Just watch me n─owww!"
5872,False,"How did I know that was going to happen...?"
5873,False,"Bam! Bam! Bam!"
5874,False,"I wouldn't mind living in a house like this myself!"
5875,False,"Keep it up, and you'll need my supervision no longer."
5876,False,"Don't get ahead of yourself, now. One nail at a time."
5877,False,"Heh! I could never have done it without you, Chief!"
5878,False,"Could it be? Are we ahead of schedule?"
5879,False,"I will endeavor to do just that, milo─er, Chief."
5880,False,"Develop an eye for quality materials, and it will serve you well."
5881,False,"Just need to smooth and polish, now..."
5882,False,"I've developed quite the discerning eye, if I do say so myself..."
5883,False,"Do we have all we need?"
5884,False,"'Tis an honor to serve, Chief."
5885,False,"You've quite an aptitude for art, I'd say."
5886,False,"I reckon I'm even more talented with a chisel than with a hammer!"
5887,False,"I mean not to boast, but I have trained some in artistic pursuits."
5888,False,"Consider it done!"
5889,False,"Here it is! You know where it all goes. Thank you kindly!"
5890,False,"Well? What do you think?"
5891,False,"Remember: the final inspection's nigh as important as the job itself."
5892,False,"This won't hold in its current state. Better to reinforce it further."
5893,False,"Not a crack or blemish to speak of!"
5894,False,"That should do it! Now, to take one final look..."
5895,False,"As you command, Chief."
5896,False,"You require a demonstration, you say? Very well, then..."
5897,False,"The key is to put your whole body into it. Now behold! Hyaaaaaaaaah!"
5898,False,"You'll get the hang of it in no time."
5899,False,"What in the hells is this made of? My axe's scarcely even scratching it!"
5900,False,"If only the chief would give me a private lesson, too..."
5901,False,"Such power!"
5902,False,"The student has become a teacher. What a marvelous sight!"
5903,False,"This task is mine─and mine alone!"
5904,False,"It's all in the hips, you see?"
5905,False,"'Tis not nearly so simple as it looks. Your wisdom is invaluable."
5906,False,"How did it go again? The chief makes it look so easy..."
5907,False,"For the Firmament! For the chief! For our future!"
5908,False,"You've come a long way, haven't you?"
5909,False,"She'll notice me sooner or later─I just know it!"
5910,False,"That's the way!"
5911,False,"He-YAH!"
5912,False,"Is my work satisfactory?"
5913,False,"Mark my words: you will break before me. Hah!"
5914,False,"Ngggh... Yah!"
5915,False,"To think the reconstruction effort is almost at an end... Such a bittersweet feeling, it is."
5916,False,"Well, look who's showing the rookies the ropes now!"
5917,False,"I still remember the day he first joined up. He's like a whole new man!"
5918,False,"Worry not─I'll show you how it's done!"
5919,False,"You are truly a generous teacher, my friend."
5920,False,"Don't overdo it. Injure yourself, and you'll be no use to anyone."
5921,False,"You've got a knack for numbers. We've sorely needed someone like you."
5922,False,"This is quality stone, Chief! I can vouch for it!"
5923,False,"I can't shake the feeling that we're running low..."
5924,False,"I've done the calculations, and I do believe we have sufficient quantities of everything."
5925,False,"I just finished my count─I guarantee you I overlooked nothing!"
5926,False,"Thanks to you, I've neither a dearth nor a surplus of supplies!"
5927,False,"That's the last task on my list. I'd best check back at the skybuilders' board."
5928,False,"Aha...duly noted."
5929,False,"Everything seems to be in good order here."
5930,False,"Yes, <hex:021A020203>this<hex:021A020103>! <hex:021A020203>This<hex:021A020103> shall be my magnum opus!"
5931,False,"Oho! I can scarcely wait to see the finished work!"
5932,False,"Is there no limit to this man's talent and passion!?"
5933,False,"Why, it is as if the city comes to life on his canvas!"
5934,False,"Are my eyes to be believed?"
5935,False,"Practice makes perfect, after all!"
5936,False,"My fingers don't sting for once! Amazing!"
5937,False,"Pray teach me to wield the hammer with such skill."
5938,False,"Excellent. Make sure to teach the others."
5939,False,"Looking good. Carry on, carry on..."
5940,False,"Precision and speed. Both are essential..."
5941,False,"Where'd the chief go...?"
5942,False,"Might I trouble you to inspect my work, Chief?"
5943,False,"Hyah! Hyah!"
5944,False,"But of course! I'll be finished here any moment..."
5945,False,"We have another task for you..."
5946,False,"Look at how he's grown..."
5947,False,"Generous souls went out of their way to gather these materials for us. We must make the most of them."
5948,False,"Remember, quantity means nothing without quality!"
5949,False,"I am indebted to you for your wisdom."
5950,False,"I can scarce feel my hands!"
5951,False,"Have we finished, then...?"
5952,False,"She's twitching... Is that normal?"
5953,False,"Nothing quite like a kiln-fresh familiar."
5954,False,"I never knew familiar-creation could be so rough..."
5955,False,"Do you reckon these are dry yet?"
5956,False,"Welcome to the Firmament, my dear madam! What brings you to these heavenly environs today?"
5957,False,"I make for the Abacus. They say some most exquisite silks from the Far East have arrived!"
5958,False,"How splendid! Might I have the honor of escorting you there?"
5959,False,"You are far too kind, my good ser. 'Twould be a pleasure."
5960,False,"Fine furs and hides to shelter your skin from the bitter cold!"
5961,False,"Have anythin' what needs fixin'? I'm your man!"
5962,False,"I've never seen anything quite like it..."
5963,False,"Say no more, my good man! I have everything you need..."
5964,False,"Do you perchance have needles and thread in supply? I mean to learn weaving..."
5965,False,"Mayhap I, too, will write my memoirs one day..."
5966,False,"Ow! I want to find whoever dropped that kupo nut on the street and slap them silly!"
5967,False,"To soak a bit longer or head for the steam baths? <hex:021A020203>That<hex:021A020103> is the question..."
5968,False,"What a breathtaking sight...!"
5969,False,""
5970,False,"A studio befitting my prodigious talents!"
5971,False,"My masterpieces will surely fetch good coin in Featherfall..."
5972,False,"I will stop at nothing to see the Firmament safe for residents and visitors alike!"
5973,False,"All right, time to make the rounds again..."
5974,False,"This is our new home! Isn't it lovely?"
5975,False,"How warm and toasty it must be inside!"
5976,False,"How long does she mean to keep me waiting...?"
5977,False,"I bought some fine wine from a distant land. What say we raise a toast?"
5978,False,"Beg pardon, but what are you doing in front of our house?"
5979,False,"Finally, my dear sister and I have a home of our own!"
5980,False,"Let's go inside. We'll catch our death of cold out here."
5981,False,"The child will meet us here, they say?"
5982,False,"So I was told. Let us give her the warmest of welcomes."
5983,False,"W-Welcome, child─er, my daughter."
5984,False,"Forgive your father, my dear. He can be terribly stiff on these occasions."
5985,False,"Father! Mother! How happy I am to be part of your family!"
5986,False,"Well, doesn't your coat look so warm and toasty!"
5987,False,"Baaaaaa! Baaaaaa!"
5988,False,"And what a fine nest this is!"
5989,False,"Thanks to Ehll Tou, we're now allowed to live here, too!"
5990,False,"My back aches just looking at her..."
5991,False,"It's all in the hips!"
5992,False,"Well, look who's come to visit!"
5993,False,"Might I join you, kupo?"
5994,False,"'Tis my duty to see that all the instruments are tuned to perfection."
5995,False,"What a magnificent structure! Whatever do you suppose it's for?"
5996,False,"They say it's to serve as lodgings for luminaries and guests of honor."
5997,False,"No entry allowed. The interior is still undergoing renovations."
5998,False,"But that's all the coin I have..."
5999,False,"The other vendors may not be open for business yet, but we certainly are!"
6000,False,"How far this place has come..."
6001,False,"So these are our new barracks, eh?"
6002,False,"We'll need to ensure they're properly outfitted..."
6003,False,"Just look at this place! When are we moving in?"
6004,False,"Grow strong, my seedlings..."
6005,False,"Headed to the Pillars? They're just beyond here."
6006,False,"Ahhh! Who needs a waterfall when we have this right here in town?"
6007,False,"When will they let us in to play?"
6008,False,"Baaaaaa!"
6009,False,"Poor thing! Are you lost?"
6010,False,"Where, oh where did my dear little Dolly run off to!?"
6011,False,"The owner of this home is a stickler for detail. I don't want to see a single nail out of place!"
6012,False,"Oh, thank you for lighting my lovelies. Did they not shine so beautifully in the sky?"
6013,False,"Captain... Pray let me retire while my limbs are still intact..."
6014,False,"Oh! I know the perfect lullaby!"
6015,False,"Whatever must I do to get you to close your eyes...?"
6016,False,"Let's take it to old Marcelloix's shop. There's nothing he can't fix."
6017,False,"It's broken! Whatever can I do, Grandpa?"
6018,False,"I...I'm f-fine! Honest!"
6019,False,"Worry not! I'll catch you!"
6020,False,"Next, it's my time to shine!"
6021,False,"Ah, nothing like a dance to forget one's worries!"
6022,False,"They'll never think to look for me here..."
6023,False,"Looks like it wasn't such a good hiding place after all..."
6024,False,"And now you're on our side. Let's look for the other two!"
6025,False,"Haha! Found you!"
6026,False,"Ungh..."
6027,False,"Only healers and staff are permitted on the upper levels."
6028,False,"Nothing I can't bear. I will be out of this place in no time."
6029,False,"Does it hurt, my dear?"
6030,False,"What I wouldn't give to walk the streets again..."
6031,False,"Now where did I leave that phial?"
6032,False,"Did you sleep well?"
6033,False,"But I'm glad you didn't keep me waiting here too long!"
6034,False,"All looks in order, you say? Splendid!"
6035,False,"Hah! That's what I like to see."
6036,False,"Not a scratch on it, Chief!"
6037,False,"No issues in terms of quantity or quality, milord."
6038,False,"How do our stores hold up?"
6039,False,"Have you any tasks for me?"
6040,False,"Have I ever! Where to begin...?"
6041,False,"Fine, ignore me like that! I'll show them I can do the work as well as anyone."
6042,False,"No rest for the weary..."
6043,False,"This is taking its toll on my back..."
6044,False,"Indeed..."
6045,False,"This one's a quick learner..."
6046,False,"Rest is important, too! Even the chief says so!"
6047,False,"That's not fair! You're better at this than me!"
6048,False,"I do believe I've got the knack of this..."
6049,False,"You've grown into a fine craftsman!"
6050,False,"You've got skill, that much is certain."
6051,False,"How does it look, Chief?"
6052,False,"I'm working hard, too, Chief! Look at me!"
6053,False,"Fingers out of the way... Steady, now..."
6054,False,"If I had two hammers...♪"
6055,False,"Not a single nail sticking out─superb!"
6056,False,"All tasks are proceeding apace!"
6057,False,"How do we fare?"
6058,False,"I'm working hard, I promise!"
6059,False,"No delays─that's what I like to see."
6060,False,"Concentrate...concentrate..."
6061,False,"<sniffle> How they've grown..."
6062,False,"Would be nice to walk these streets together when our work is done..."
6063,False,"Soon, we'll be going our separate ways..."
6064,False,"That's the way!"
6065,False,"I'm taking a nice hot bath soon as my work is done."
6066,False,"Yes, this should more than suffice."
6067,False,"I said <hex:021A020203>don't<hex:021A020103> look down!"
6068,False,"The end is in sight! No slacking off till the job is done!"
6069,False,"Fascinating..."
6070,False,"Where do you suppose the chief will go when the work is done...?"
6071,False,"'Twould be my pleasure."
6072,False,"Why, yes...all appears to be in good order."
6073,False,"The chief says not a single spot is to be overlooked."
6074,False,"Oh, thank the heavens! I knew I could count on you!"
6075,False,"Why does no one come to my aid!? Can they not see the pain I'm in!?"
6076,False,"Do not abandon me so! Oh, how I suffer!"
6077,False,"You again. What is it this time?"
6078,False,"This goes here, and─yes, that should be right."
6079,False,"We could have used one of these earlier."
6080,False,"Now for the finishing touch!"
6081,False,"Soon, they shall all be connected..."
6082,False,"They're convenient enough to use, but a real hassle to carry..."
6083,False,"Where does this go again?"
6084,False,"I've been working as hard as anyone! Harder, even! The hardest!"
6085,False,"It is hard to believe our work is almost done..."
6086,False,"Truly, this is my greatest work yet!"
6087,False,"Yes! My muse speaks to me!"
6088,False,"You have done well to come this far!"
6089,False,"Thanks to you, Lord Francel's vision for the Firmament is realized at last!"
6090,False,"You should be proud of yourselves today. Hold your heads high!"
6091,False,"I have no words..."
6092,False,"Huzzah! Huzzah!"
6093,False,"My muscles throb, but my spirit sings!"
6094,False,"This should loosen you up..."

6547,False,"Is this all the cargo? I should triple-check..."
6548,False,"Mom said we'd head home half an hour ago, but they keep talking..."
6549,False,"That tome... Could it be...?"
6550,False,"How do we feel about the Forum's actions as of late?"
6551,False,"Permit me to share my thoughts about today's lecture. You see... "
6552,False,"The ship should be arriving soon, but I don't see anything in the offing..."
6553,False,"See here? This cannot be right. We'll have to start again."
6554,False,"Let's see... Is this everything to be transported to Labyrinthos?"
6555,False,"You seem a bit burdened with work. Shall I lend you a hand?"
6556,False,"Did you hear about the consortium?"
6557,False,"May these days of ease and comfort last forevermore... "
6558,False,"All done with your shopping, I hope? Or do you have to run back <hex:021A020203>again<hex:021A020103>?"
6559,False,"Have a care and take a step back, would you? I won't have you distracting me."
6560,False,"Welcome, travelers, to the vibrant city of Radz–at–Han!"
6561,False,"Let's see, what would keep the senses sharp even in the small hours?"
6562,False,"Seems we need more medicines and philters."
6563,False,"So, the thing about a good merchant is... "
6564,False,"Never do I feel more myself than when I watch a performance."
6565,False,"How fare the markets of late?"
6566,False,"Do you not see it? We will never again have such an opportunity for expansion!"
6567,False,"All you could possibly want, we have for you right here! And at the best prices, no less!"
6568,False,"I've seen naught better, 'tis true, but my coinpurse is rather...light these days."
6569,False,"These colors are truly exquisite. So vibrant!"
6570,False,"One final touch remains, and then I shall be finished."
6571,False,"The soil is good, the water is clear─I could not ask for better conditions."
6572,False,"No, I'm good this ti─oh, wait! There's one more thing. But I promise this is it!"
6573,False,"Goodness me, where to start?"
6574,False,"And all this is meant for...ah yes, Sharlayan Hamlet."
6575,False,"These conditions are excellent, so they should keep a great while."
6576,False,"Gesticulate at me all you like, but that specimen is in need of another test."
6577,False,"Why, just look at them. They'll grow up big and strong soon enough!"
6578,False,"One must always be learning, even during periods of rest."
6579,False,"You call these documents research?<hex:02100103>They're not even worth wiping the privy floor with!"
6580,False,"I've not heard a thing about when the blasted research is due! You?"
6581,False,"All appears very much in order here, I would say."
6582,False,"Check it again, would you? We cannot be too careful. "
6583,False,"Could we not expand the markets? Open a few new shops?"
6584,False,"Gently... Gently now... Remember what happened last time."
6585,False,"I must remain calm. I must find my inner peace. Breathe in... Breathe out."
6586,False,"I will hone both my mind and my body into the satrap's sharpest blade!"
6587,False,"Am I ever glad to be stationed so close to a campfire!"
6588,False,"This is perilous terrain, you hear me? Keep your guard up at all times!"
6589,False,"What wretched weather to be laboring in.<hex:02100103>As if this work weren't hard enough!"
6590,False,"You there! Empty your satchel right now!"
6591,False,"If any of these get too damp,<hex:02100103>it could spell trouble for us."
6592,False,"It...hurts... "
6593,False,"Why did I live,<hex:02100103>when so many others...?"
6594,False,"The air is ice itself.<hex:02100103>I may freeze to death at this rate."
6595,False,"<sniffle> I-I'm hungry...!"
6596,False,"Damn it all...! Is there truly nothing to be done!?"
6597,False,"M-My wife, my daughter, too... Th-They both... "
6598,False,"Processing power: optimal. Overall status: fantastic!"
6599,False,"Listen, everyone, or you'll miss your next assignments!"
6600,False,"Oh goodness me, what was I told to do again?"
6601,False,"Suppose this needs an overhaul, now they've changed specifications on us."
6602,False,"Th-This is much taller than I initially thought. Oh dear, I feel dizzy."
6603,False,"Well, this will all need to be redone, I imagine."
6604,False,"There must be something to be done about this. Come now, think, think, think... "
6605,False,"High time we got serious─put our backs into it!"
6606,False,"I...just can't seem to...<yawn> stop nodding off... "
6607,False,"Nothing for it. Only one thing to be done─scrap it all and start over!"
6608,False,"Work harder, I say! No, no─<hex:021A020203>harder<hex:021A020103>! Don't make me come down there!"
6609,False,"We finish this today, understand? So hop to it!"
6610,False,"Sir, yes, sir!"
6611,False,"Aw, there's a good plant. Grow up nice and strong for me, all right?"
6612,False,"Yes, this will serve us just fine, I should think!"
6613,False,"These really are stunning. Can't quite take my eyes off them, in fact."
6614,False,"Is there anything more beautiful than watching the cycle of life at work?"
6615,False,"Just a few samples ought to suffice, I should imagine."
6616,False,"Rest is vital for one's efficiency, you know?"
6617,False,"There, there. All is well. You've nothing to fear."
6618,False,"This would make a fine location for the rearing of aquatic creatures."
6619,False,"You overexert yourself, and your health will suffer for it. Rest, I beg you."
6620,False,"You did marvelously in your flight training today. Very well done indeed!"
6621,False,"Given its body weight and the effort it requires to remain aloft, I would say this creature can fly for... "
6622,False,"It is as if a thick fog has settled over my mind."
6623,False,"All is nothingness, forever and on... "
6624,False,"Ah, yes... I've hit upon a fine verse, haven't I? Heh... Heh... "
6625,False,"Recharge required. Please leave this unit alone."
6626,False,"Is there truly naught to be done with the silks that remain?"
6627,False,"All this here needs to be brought straight to the piers, understood?"
6628,False,"Hm... Perhaps a few adjustments are in order."
6629,False,"...Well, this stinks."
6630,False,"Daresay we have stores enough to last us awhile. That is some comfort."
6631,False,"Heavens, this...is <oof> quite a task. My muscles'll be aching tomorrow!"
6632,False,"I've only...just...begun! Take this, rocks!"
6633,False,"Oh dear me, no. I'm too high up! Somebody─anybody! Get me down!"
6634,False,"High time we built ourselves more scaffolding. That next level is looking lonely."
6635,False,"Should you need anything─anything at all─say the word and it shall be yours."
6636,False,"I've many and more shipments left to place, so do return as soon as you are able."
6637,False,"Is that the last of the cargo?"
6638,False,"Hm... Doesn't look like the next vessel will be arriving any time soon..."
6639,False,"Fascinating! You simply <hex:021A020203>must<hex:021A020103> tell me more about your research."
6640,False,"The cargo list was already submitted. Let me check the registry..."
6641,False,"Perhaps I'll buy a new tome to accompany me on my journey."
6642,False,"Have you visited that shop over there? The owner certainly has the gift of the gab!"
6643,False,"I could use a drink or three... Somethin' to take the edge off."
6644,False,"I'm pleased our paths could cross once more."
6645,False,"Looking forward to serving you again soon!"
6646,False,"Careful there! What you carry is incredibly fragile."
6647,False,"The numbers you gave me aren't adding up. Are you sure you counted correctly?"
6648,False,"If you spot any nasty-looking vilekin, come straight to me, understand?"
6649,False,"All right, I'd say I've earned myself a quick rest!"
6650,False,"...You aren't looking for help with another experiment, are you?"
6651,False,"Is...there...no end?"
6652,False,"I, er...just remembered that I'm terribly busy. Farewell! "
6653,False,"Do be sure to procure more of the material we discussed."
6654,False,"Those berries are the most tastyfresh gobbietreats!"
6655,False,"I've never seen them before... They aren't dangerous, are they?"
6656,False,"Not at all! Very safe! Safe for uplanders to yummyeat!"
6657,False,"Gobbies never lie. So let us sell our goodygoods!"
6658,False,"Well, don't these look delicious? My, my, that color. How unique!"
6659,False,"They do look good, don't they? It's hard to pick just one."
6660,False,"They're a real treat, I assure you. Buy one─your palate'll thank you for it!"
6661,False,"I'm famished. Shall we grab a bite to eat?"
6662,False,"Yes, let's. At the cafeteria, then? I'm on a rather tight budget..."
6663,False,"I could smell this all day long, I could!"
6664,False,"Bring that to the storehouse, would you?"
6665,False,"Very well. The second storehouse, I presume?"
6666,False,"You're telling me. Patrols are more exhausting than they seem."
6667,False,"Never did I think we would have the chance to speak again."
6668,False,"Likewise. It's a miracle we are here at all."
6669,False,"Your patronage is always appreciated. "
6670,False,"Why of course. You've such a fine collection of wares, how could go I to anyone else?"
6671,False,"I have business at Aporia, if you wouldn't mind letting me through."
6672,False,"Why certainly, provided you have the requisite documents."
6673,False,"I was asked to adjust the temperature in here. Apparently, some find it too stuffy. "
6674,False,"I concur. You might want to do something about the humidity, too, while you're at it."
6675,False,"Looks like there's no more fruit fertilizer..."
6676,False,"Could you let them know for me?"
6677,False,"Why, certainly, ribbit!"
6678,False,"Isn't there <hex:021A020203>something<hex:021A020103> we can do to further fortify our walls?"
6679,False,"No─at least, not without new materials, there isn't."
6680,False,"What happened to those supplies you ordered a while back?"
6681,False,"Come to think of it, I haven't received them yet."
6682,False,"I ask that you divide the inspection duties amongst yourselves."
6683,False,"I sHaLl BeGiN oVeR tHeRe."
6684,False,"AnD i ShAlL sTaRt ThErE."
6685,False,"Then I'll inspect this section, ribbit!"
6686,False,"Is there such a thing as an end, if there is no beginning? Makes one think."
6687,False,"Its temperament appears to be somewhat more stable, to be sure."
6688,False,"I say we let it loose for a bit, see how it behaves."
6689,False,"It appears to have moss growing on its head..."
6690,False,"Indeed. They must be living in perfect symbiosis. "
6691,False,"Maybe you do, too. Would explain why it's taken such a liking to you."
6692,False,"E-Error c-c-c-code 4014. Unknown m-m-m-malfunction."
6693,False,"Damage to system detected. Attempting to restore."
6694,False,"Well, here's a conundrum: which carrots should we start with?"
6695,False,"I vote philosopher's carrots. They'll keep us light on our feet!"
6696,False,"No, no─iron carrots first. We won't get far without bulging thews!"
6697,False,"What food do you think mankind likes?"
6698,False,"Oh, excellent question... "
6699,False,"Well, carrots, surely."
6700,False,"All right, this water quality won't check itself! Let's get to it."
6701,False,"Visual inspection complete. Status: crystal clear!"
6702,False,"<slurp> Taste inspection complete. Status: delicious!"
6703,False,"<sniff> <sniff> Scent inspection complete. Status: bracing!"
6704,False,"How goes the system change?"
6705,False,"Oh, about as well as can be expected."
6706,False,"Honestly, if it weren't for bad luck, we'd have no luck at all."
6707,False,"You mustn't worry, darling. I am sure he managed to escape, just like we did."
6708,False,"<sniffle> Wh-Where's Daddy? D-Did he...?"
6709,False,"Tell me, where does it hurt?"
6710,False,"My arm. Argh, it's killing me...!"
6711,False,"Oh dear. Well, that isn't good, now is it?"
6712,False,"Help me! Aaah!"
6713,False,"And what of our stores of perishables? What shall we do with them?"
6714,False,"Sell them, that's what. At cost, if we must."
6715,False,"A tad drastic, don't you think? The tavern may yet pay full price."
6716,False,"Here's the cargo you requested, sir."
6717,False,"You're one shipment too early! Take it back."
6718,False,"I'm afraid you have a bit too much cargo for me to collect..."
6719,False,"Indeed. You go and call for help, I'll stay here and keep watch."
6720,False,"I wonder if they've finished with the evaluation yet..."
6721,False,"What's the status of this cargo?"
6722,False,"DoCuMeNtS cUrReNtLy UnDeR rEvIeW. pLeAsE wAiT."
6723,False,"Got any cargo for me to collect?"
6724,False,"Not yet. Come back once I've finished reviewing this load."
6725,False,"Ah, there you are. Do you have a moment?"
6726,False,"For you, madam? I've all the time in the world."
6727,False,"Last Stand-bound, are you? Today's brew was truly exquisite."
6728,False,"Good to know. I will pay them a visit on my way to the Forum."
6729,False,"BoOkShElF iNsPeCtIoN cOmPleTe. PrEsErVaTiOn StAtUs: GoOd."
6730,False,"We've still got enough rations, by the looks of it."
6731,False,"Brought you more supplies, if you've the space for it."
6732,False,"Ah, thank you. Let me see... Oh, terribly sorry, but this belongs over there."
6733,False,"Why, this might actually work."
6734,False,"And where am I to deliver all this to, exactly?"
6735,False,"Ruveydah Fibers, if you wouldn't mind?"
6736,False,"Have anything else which needs delivering?"
6737,False,"Is that meant in jest? Of course there is. All you see here, in fact."
6738,False,"I've your deliveries here."
6739,False,"Ah, excellent. Thank you."
6740,False,"Point me to what next needs delivering, if you would be so kind."
6741,False,"Let's see... Ah yes, these here if you wouldn't mind?"
6742,False,"Still rifling through materials, are you?"
6743,False,"Unfortunately... I'm struggling to find just the right tome."
6744,False,"We'll have to replenish the feed stock..."
6745,False,"There's barely anything left!"
6746,False,"Have the goods I ordered arrived?"
6747,False,"Not yet, I'm afraid."
6748,False,"How unfortunate. I'll check back later, then."
6749,False,"Excuse me. Do you have any digestives?"
6750,False,"We do stock them, but we just sold out. My apologies..."
6751,False,"Spare some extra material?"
6752,False,"You're out already? <sigh> Fine─but be frugal with it."
6753,False,"Be honest: how much of today's lecture did you understand?"
6754,False,"Honestly? Not a word."
6755,False,"You too, eh? Let's hope we fare better in the next one, then."
6756,False,"Right then! I'm off to the High Crucible."
6757,False,"Give my regards to everyone there, won't you?"
6758,False,"No irregularities detected."
6759,False,"Oh... I've forgotten what I've come here to do."
6760,False,"It is as if my mind is drifting further and further away... Slowly, so slowly. "
6761,False,"And where is it you are going, pray tell?"
6762,False,"The Bureau of the Architect, if you must know. I've a highly original concept..."
6763,False,"Don't you even <hex:021A020203>think<hex:021A020103> of fertilizing that!"
6764,False,"But my magnum opus!"
6765,False,"I've got the goods."
6766,False,"No wear! Clothes itchy!"
6767,False,"Tiny hippo. ...Must protect."
6768,False,"Look here─just <hex:021A020203>try<hex:021A020103> wearin' some, eh?"
6769,False,"I thought I told you to stop following me!"
6770,False,"Over here, big fellow!"
6771,False,"Take aim and blast this fell beast!"
6772,False,"Retreat! Every man for himself!"
6773,False,"He spoke to me! He actually spoke to me!"
6774,False,"It's Alphinaud himself, in the flesh!"
6775,False,"Looks clear..."
6776,False,"I can't feel my hands..."
6777,False,"Got to keep moving!"
6778,False,"I know you're up to no good!"
6779,False,"<gasp>"
6780,False,"Perhaps I lost <hex:02080DE905FF04>her<hex:FF04>him<hex:03>... "
6781,False,"This way's blocked, too?"
6782,False,"I'm going home, no matter what!"
6783,False,"M-Must have been the wind."
6784,False,"I-Is someone there?"
6785,False,"Th-This can't be... "
6786,False,"So far, so good..."
6787,False,"Is someone there?"
6788,False,"I must be imagining things."
6789,False,"Better catch my breath..."
6790,False,"If those beasts spot me, I'm done for."
6791,False,"I hope my luck holds..."
6792,False,"Got to keep going... They're all depending on me!"
6793,False,"Just a little farther!"
6794,False,"This is it, the final spurt!"
6795,False,"This way. Hurry!"
6796,False,"Mum, I'm coming!"
6797,False,"Please, we have to hurry!"
6798,False,"She's just a little further!"
6799,False,"Over that hill, right?"
6800,False,"This must be the road he mentioned."
6801,False,"If we follow this, it should lead to the station."
6802,False,"Not the easiest surface to run on..."
6803,False,"We'd better not draw attention."
6804,False,"That's the station, I presume."
6805,False,"......"
6806,False,"What're you looking at? This isn't a show!"
6807,False,"Huh...?"
6808,False,"Whaaa...?"
6809,False,"Can't wait to turn this into good coin and treat myself to a drink!"
6810,False,"Hm? Am I hearing things?"
6811,False,"Let's keep following him...while keeping a good distance."
6812,False,"It gets a bit tight from here. We must be wary..."
6813,False,"That one looks like trouble. Must be an accomplice..."
6814,False,"The streets of Radz–at–Han are most colorful, don't you think?"
6815,False,"We must find whatever evidence we can and help that poor woman."
6816,False,"Bweee!"
6817,False,"Whatever is the meaning of this!? Where is the satrap!?"
6818,False,"I... I saw it! That terrible beast..."
6819,False,"By the gods! Is everyone all right?"
6820,False,"We escaped somehow, but... What in heavens' name is happening to our fair city!?"
6821,False,"Surely the satrap will offer his wisdom and guidance to us..."
6822,False,"The density, however..."
6823,False,"When you put it that way..."
6824,False,"Will so much dust not cause respiratory problems?"
6825,False,"It's fine to admit you're scared, you know?"
6826,False,"In the long run, however, most of you won't die!"
6827,False,"That estimate seems accurate to me..."
6828,False,"Mew!"
6829,False,"Mew, mew? Mew!"
6830,False,"<chitter> <chitter> Hee!"
6831,False,"<chitter> Hee?"
6832,False,"<whirr>..."
6833,False,"Reassessing behavior."
6834,False,"<blip> <bloop>"
6835,False,""
6836,False,"That should do it."
6837,False,"Are you quite certain?"
6838,False,"Just look at the size of it!"
6839,False,"It's not the size..."
6840,False,"I just adore this stained glass piece."
6841,False,"Such amazing detail!"
6842,False,"Is “fair fortune” any good?"
6843,False,"Er, what did it say again?"
6844,False,"Probably?"
6845,False,"Says I should find me's a scuffle."
6846,False,"R-Rabbits are the theme this year!?"
6847,False,"What a curious custom,<hex:02100103>this Heavensturn business."
6848,False,"Pay me lyin' whoreson o' a man a visit, then."
6849,False,"You've tried five times already!"
6850,False,"Must...get...great...fortune..."
6851,False,"Mayhap I'll draw a lot myself..."
6852,False,"I demand we be friends!"
6853,False,"<sigh> Because of your fortune?"
6854,False,"They certainly seem to be enjoying themselves."
6855,False,"Hmm... More salt, maybe?"
6856,False,"Nothin' like a good scrub, eh?"
6857,False,"Grub's fresh!"
6858,False,"Work's been pickin' up recently."
6859,False,"Glad tidings indeed!"
6860,False,"Hmm..."
6861,False,"Can't we do somethin' 'bout this?"
6862,False,"Hallo, chums."
6863,False,"Hallo!"
6864,False,"How's it rollin'?"
6865,False,"What do you reckon we do with this, eh?"
6866,False,"Whatever the boss wants!"
6867,False,"I wonder what she's got in mind... Wanna ask?"
6868,False,"Open wide! Here comes another!"
6869,False,"Oooh, now <hex:021A020203>that's<hex:021A020103> a big mess."
6870,False,"There's a good hippo... You rest up, alright?"
6871,False,"We've found all the treasure, then?"
6872,False,"What is this place?"
6873,False,"A hidden room within a hidden vault... "
6874,False,"Hmmm, a fitting sentinel..."
6875,False,"How about some hamsa skewers, sir?"
6876,False,"How many fish is that fellow plannin' to eat...?"
6877,False,"No, no! Fish! Bring me more fish!"
6878,False,"You alright on parts there?"
6879,False,"That looks right...right?"
6880,False,"Hey! Mind yourself, eh!?"
6881,False,"Sisters bury me─I'm laaaaaate!"
6882,False,"So far, so good! Thanks!"
6883,False,"So the difficult course starts from there, eh?"
6884,False,"Congratulations!"
6885,False,"You're something else!"
6886,False,"Well done!"
6887,False,"<gulp> G-Gotta time it just right..."
6888,False,"N-No, oh please no! I-I can't swim!"

7645,False,"This one's also growing healthily."
7646,False,"Good, I don't see any pests."
7647,False,"A lovely idea. I'll see<hex:02100103>to the arrangements."
7648,False,"Get your local<hex:02100103>specialties here!"
7649,False,"My, everything looks<hex:02100103>like a qualitymake!"
7650,False,"What would you say to a gathering of our fellow merchants?"
7651,False,"I refuse! I've lowered<hex:02100103>the price enough!"
7652,False,"Yeah, it's damned smooth..."
7653,False,"Quality liquor, isn't it?"
7654,False,"The Pelupelu are keen to purchase that item..."
7655,False,"How much are they<hex:02100103>willing to pay?"
7656,False,"Lower! Too expensive!"
7657,False,"Ahhh..."
7658,False,"I can feel the aches of my travels just melting away..."
7659,False,"Skin feels all moist and slick─even under mobbiemask!"
7660,False,"Nothing beats a drink after a hot bath!"
7661,False,"You're only going to order mezcal?"
7662,False,"Indeed. I'm rather<hex:02100103>fond of the stuff."
7663,False,"You're drinking mezcal?"
7664,False,"There's no better time than<hex:02100103>after a hard day's work."
7665,False,"I'm impressed you can drink.<hex:02100103>I'm utterly exhausted."
7666,False,"How fare the murals?"
7667,False,"For a blessing, well."
7668,False,"Whew..."
7669,False,"What a beauty..."
7670,False,"How fares your new Everkeep assignment?"
7671,False,"Wait─we're one short? I'll check the storehouse..."
7672,False,"Everything looks to be accounted for..."
7673,False,"Could I interest anyone in a light meal?"
7674,False,"That would be wonderful, thank you!"
7675,False,"Let me just finish telling this story first."
7676,False,"Of course, sweetheart. I'll see you inside."
7677,False,"Any problems with the machinery?"
7678,False,"Everything looks to be stable, sir!"
7679,False,"It had better be, or this town will fall apart."
7680,False,"This place will be good for me, I can feel it."
7681,False,"What'll you make next?"
7682,False,"I haven't decided yet."
7683,False,"My, that's not like you. If you need any ideas, I'm full of them!"
7684,False,"Let's see... Should I put this here?"
7685,False,"Hey, is this the right box?"
7686,False,"It's the wrong one─check the label!"
7687,False,"Huh? Are you sure?"
7688,False,"There's a list in the storeroom. I suggest you read it closely."
7689,False,"A great catch requires great patience."
7690,False,"This seems like a good spot to cast."
7691,False,"Maybe today I'll catch a fish larger than myself..."
7692,False,"Hmm... It might be time to move."
7693,False,"I can see the fish under the water!"
7694,False,"Whoooaaa!"
7695,False,"No bites here either..."
7696,False,"The fish I caught here last time fed me for a week!"
7697,False,"No bites... What am I doing wrong?"
7698,False,"I'll take a break, then try again..."
7699,False,"How goes the fishing?"
7700,False,"<snore> Zzz..."
7701,False,"Not well, it seems."
7702,False,"Any bites today?"
7703,False,"Too many to count!"
7704,False,"Well done!"
7705,False,"I think I can catch a few more..."
7706,False,"Good luck! I should go check on the dried fish."
7707,False,"It's time to collect the fish!"
7708,False,"The reeds are bursting with life once again!"
7709,False,"They're beautiful..."
7710,False,"The water is just right."
7711,False,"The depth looks perfect."
7712,False,"I think our reed problems are behind us."
7713,False,"They grow with such vigor!"
7714,False,"Where did I put them again?"
7715,False,"Here...?"
7716,False,"Not here either..."
7717,False,"Have you seen my tools?"
7718,False,"I thought they were yours. Hold on."
7719,False,"...Here. Don't lose them again."
7720,False,"I won't, I promise. Many thanks!"
7721,False,"You said he wanted to talk?"
7722,False,"Yes, but..."
7723,False,"I don't know if he's awake or asleep..."
7724,False,"I see... Well, I suppose I can come back later!"
7725,False,"He should be awake by now..."
7726,False,"I can barely keep my eyes open... Hmm... Time for a short nap."
7727,False,"It's time to get to work!"
7728,False,"All right, all right. I'll be there soon!"
7729,False,"Now, the best trap to catch fish is..."
7730,False,"Interesting, interesting. But shouldn't you get to work?"
7731,False,"Oh! It completely slipped my mind!"
7732,False,"He's going to pluck my feathers!"
7733,False,"I hope he makes it... Oh! I'd better get back to work, too!"
7734,False,"Dangerstraits! Have you seen my twinklestones?"
7735,False,"Again!? You always lose them!"
7736,False,"The old boxes were replaced with new ones. Your twinklestones might be in a yellow one."
7737,False,"Oh, thank you, thank you! I will look!"
7738,False,"Oh, happyfeels! I found my twinklestones!"
7739,False,"Don't misplace them again!"
7740,False,"You must keep carefulwatch over storage and supplies! Don't let them get mixed up."
7741,False,"I won't make any more mistakes!"
7742,False,"Wonderdeeds! Keep it up!"
7743,False,"It's all coming together!"
7744,False,"Ore disappears in an eyeblink! We need more!"
7745,False,"Golden glitterstones are all the rage, I've heard!"
7746,False,"One, two! One, two! Moblins can be burlystrong, too!"
7747,False,"That's right! We'll temper our bodies like a weapon!"
7748,False,"Something greenish with a bit of red would be nice."
7749,False,"Understood! Mobbie will craftymake you something astounding!"
7750,False,"What will I catch today?"
7751,False,"Gazing at the rivers usually sets my mind at ease, but during the storm they were a nightmare..."
7752,False,"I know what you mean. The flooding waters were a chilling sight."
7753,False,"Are these the goods you were talking about?"
7754,False,"No! The crate I'm looking for is much bigger!"
7755,False,"You're serious, aren't you? Well, I'll be back then..."
7756,False,"My son struggles to command the wind."
7757,False,"Where shall we strike our next deal, I wonder? What do you think?"
7758,False,"I'm going to tumblefall!"
7759,False,"It's not high! Just fall─you'll barely hurtyfeel it! Let go!"
7760,False,"Nooo! Neveeer!"
7761,False,"Perhaps it's time we replaced our hover cargo."
7762,False,"Now for today's shipment..."
7763,False,"How goes the safety assessment?"
7764,False,"Lightning levels seem normal. All clear."
7765,False,"Remind me, where do we send the ore shipments?"
7766,False,"First level. It has to pass inspection, remember?"
7767,False,"Bureaucracy at its finest."
7768,False,"Huh... I guess I had it right all along."
7769,False,"All items accounted for. Now to set the destination..."
7770,False,"One of my friends was just assigned the role of hunter!"
7771,False,"Gods, I wish it were me. <sigh> If only I'd passed the exam..."
7772,False,"Is this all the scrap we're bringing to Everkeep?"
7773,False,"Not quite. The reforgers told me they've found something in the ruins."
7774,False,"How are we doing, ladies? Hungry?"
7775,False,"Conversion rate looks normal."
7776,False,"That's it...<hex:02100103>Grow nice and tasty for me..."
7777,False,"At this stage, we'll need mesh to keep the bugs off."
7778,False,"Then I'd better put an order in!"
7779,False,"Note to self─buy tarps.<hex:02100103>Lots of tarps."
7780,False,"And bug repellent!<hex:02100103>We really don't want an oglop infestation."
7781,False,"No one's following..."
7782,False,"Is someone there?"
7783,False,"I'm in the clear... I need to hurry!"
7784,False,"I made it!"
7785,False,"D-Did something move?"
7786,False,"It's just my imagination..."
7787,False,"You're with <hex:021A020203>her<hex:021A020103>!?"
7788,False,"The map points here!"
7789,True,"Balloons! Grab your balloons to the Endless House here!"
7790,False,"We're short on just about everything because of this war..."
7791,False,"<sigh> Will there ever be peace again?"
7792,False,"Come on, let's go and see the princess!"
7793,False,"R-Right... Oh gods, I'm so nervous..."
7794,False,"From her memories, she will be reborn to lead us always."
7795,False,"Our eternal queen... This is a new dawn for the realm."
7796,False,"I can't make it... I can't take another step..."
7797,False,"Don't give up! We're almost to the castle!"
7798,False,"Ah, another beautiful day beneath Everkeep's barrier."
7799,False,"What does the future hold for us...?"
7800,False,"Did you hear the rumors about the queen?"
7801,False,"You mean that her memories were preserved?"
7802,False,"Decorations are pretty, ain't they?"
7803,False,"The whole city is. We should travel like this more often."
7804,False,"See!? I told you it'd be worth the journey!"
7805,False,"Yes, it was quite a display."
7806,False,"Still adventuring, are you?"
7807,False,"Of course! Why, just the other day..."
7808,False,"Sicard worked awfully hard this Rising."
7809,False,"Mayhap I should make him some small gift, in recognition of his efforts."
7810,False,"I'm sure he would like that very much, my lord."
7811,False,"Whither shall we venture next?"
7812,False,"I don't know. The bar?"
7813,False,"Did you see the fireworks?"
7814,False,"That I did! Nearly went overboard gawpin' at 'em!"
7815,False,"Reckon folks were smilin' more'n ever this year!"
7816,False,"A banana...?"
7817,False,"And what flavor would that be?"
7818,False,"Come with me for a moment."
7819,False,"I see..."
7820,False,"That smoke..."
7821,False,"Papa, look! Isn't it wonderful?"
7822,False,"Careful, lad. It's a long way down."
7823,False,"Hm... What would you like to do first?"
7824,False,"I can't decide... What would <hex:021A020203>you<hex:021A020103> like to do first?"
7825,False,"Why don't we have some ice cream?"
7826,False,"Fancy a box of our delicious cookies?"
7827,False,"One? I think I'd like three..."
7828,False,"Shall we challenge that quizzed tour again?"
7829,False,"Oh, yes! We'll have to try for a perfect score this time."
7830,False,"It's so pretty..."
7831,False,"...And he dove headfirst into the canal!"
7832,False,"Gods, I wish I could have seen it."
7833,False,"I'm so glad we can be together again..."
7834,False,"I highly recommend our Mica the Mu figurines."
7835,False,"It's been ages since we last met like this."
7836,False,"Well, we've all been rather busy..."
7837,False,"But now it's just like old times!"
7838,False,"Such splendid scenery."
7839,False,"I could gaze upon it for the rest of my days..."
7840,False,"You've not been to the Daguerreo Medical Collection?"
7841,False,"Not yet... I suppose I should pay it a visit!"
7842,False,"The water's nice and cool!"
7843,False,"I remember the day we first met..."
7844,False,"Are we allowed to swim here, I wonder...?"
7845,False,"We've plenty of sweet treats to satisfy your appetite!"
7846,False,"I-I thought you'd left me all alone..."
7847,False,"I'm so sorry, dear... You'll never be alone again."
7848,False,"That's right. We'll always be together, the three of us."
7849,False,"...And then, I tumbled right down the hill!"
7850,False,"Perhaps we could buy matching accessories..."
7851,False,"Please form a single-file line as you enter!"
7852,False,"I can't wait for the ride!"
7853,False,"This place hardly feels real..."
7854,False,"And yet it is!"
7855,False,"Mother, may I have an ice cream?"
7856,False,"Well, Father?"
7857,False,"Ask your father, love. I'm brainstorming at the moment..."
7858,False,"I'm on the cusp of a breakthrough. Why not ask your mother?"
7859,False,"I'm told the animals are quite friendly."
7860,False,"You'd best jump down before you fall."
7861,False,"I'll be fine, I promise!"
7862,False,"They've a host of rare specimens here."
7863,False,"The battles here are exhilarating!"
7864,False,"I want to stay like this forever..."
7865,False,"I wouldn't trade these quiet moments for anything."
7866,False,"Huh? Wh-Where did she go?"
7867,False,"Oh, dear... Where's he run off to now?"
7868,False,"Keep going!"
7869,False,"Perfect!"
7870,False,"Try jumping to a thousand!"
7871,False,"I-I'm feeling queasy just looking at it..."
7872,False,"So that's how the castle looked..."
7873,False,"They say this place once kept all sorts of species."
7874,False,"She's been in there a while..."
7875,False,"Ahhh, it's much cooler out here!"
7876,False,"Apologies for the wait!"
7877,False,"I'm not done yet─just taking a break."
7878,False,"All right, back to the sauna for me!"
7879,False,"I could use a break soon..."
7880,False,"Strawberry or mint chocolate chip? That is the question..."
7881,False,"That last bout was incredible!"
7882,False,"I should've bought<hex:02100103>ice cream too..."
7883,False,"Why not hurry and buy some?"
7884,False,"What'd you think<hex:02100103>of that last bout?"
7885,False,"I think the referee<hex:02100103>was full of shite!"
7886,False,"Which match are you most keen to see?"
7887,False,"The third one, of course!"
7888,False,"This's the best spot for spectatin'."
7889,False,"I wish I could<hex:02100103>compete as well..."
7890,False,"Hrruff!"
7891,False,"Mrroooh!"
7892,False,"Mrroooh! Mrroooh!"
7893,False,"Damn fleas..."
7894,False,"Ready for a brushin', girl?"
7895,False,"Shapin' up to be a good harvest."
7896,False,"We might try sellin'<hex:02100103>bangles from the potsworn."
7897,False,"I should think they'll<hex:02100103>fetch a fair price."
7898,False,"...and then you<hex:02100103>fry it with nopales."
7899,False,"That sounds amazing!"
7900,False,"The bastard swindled me!"
7901,False,"Maybe the Dustwatch can help."
7902,False,"I ain't <hic> goin'<hex:02100103>back to no springs..."
7903,False,"Not without one<hex:02100103>more drink! <hic>"

7905,False,"...A rroneek as big<hex:02100103>as a mountain, I tell ya!"
7906,False,"I think you've had<hex:02100103>too much to drink."
7907,False,"It's true! Heard it from the<hex:02100103>merchants in Tuliyollal!"
7908,False,"But the Pelupelu<hex:02100103>tell it different..."
7909,False,"Wife said it's the<hex:02100103>best she ever had."
7910,False,"Hah! Sure she did."
7911,False,"Maybe one more<hex:02100103>log wouldn't hurt."
7912,False,"Not a bug in sight. Thank goodness."
7913,False,"...And which one of you<hex:02100103>are we cooking tonight?"
7914,False,"We've had quite the<hex:02100103>harvest this season."
7915,False,"It was worth the time spent<hex:02100103>seeding the crops earlier."
7916,False,"I'm afraid we'll need more<hex:02100103>meat for the stew."
7917,False,"But I've just returned<hex:02100103>from hunting..."
7918,False,"Any tobacco to spare, friend?"
7919,False,"Sorry. All out, I'm afraid."
7920,False,"My son says he wants to go<hex:02100103>to the springs and seek work."
7921,False,"And? What did you tell him?"
7922,False,"A little more and they'll<hex:02100103>be bone dry."
7923,False,"What a lovely melody."
7924,False,"I could listen to this all day."
7925,False,"To the lake, then?"
7926,False,"Sure. I could go for a<hex:02100103>nap on the boat."
7927,False,"They'll come biting any<hex:02100103>second─I can feel it!"
7928,False,"Ah, what a pleasant breeze."
7929,False,"I hope it's a big one!"
7930,False,"You did good today, girl."

7937,False,"I heard they're planning<hex:02100103>to build another rig."
7938,False,"We're going to need more hands, then."
7939,False,""
7940,False,"A fitting arena for<hex:02100103>glorious battles!"
7941,False,"I studied up as well!"
7942,False,"This is how you<hex:02100103>cheer, right!?"
7943,False,"Fight, fight, fight!"
7944,False,"Shall we go and have a soak?"
7945,False,"Mmm..."
7946,False,"We regularly change our offerings, you see..."
7947,False,"But those were my favorite!"
7948,False,"And then, if you can believe it, this is what I said..."
7949,False,"This is the life..."
7950,False,"I think I'll have an ice cream."
7951,False,"Didn't you have one back at the arena?"
7952,False,"They have special flavors here!"
7953,False,"Well, in that case..."
7954,False,"Hehehe!"
7955,False,"Ahhh... Paradise..."
7956,False,"A bit too deep for me, perhaps..."
7957,False,"Graaagh!"
7958,False,"Hyeeeaaah!"
7959,False,"There! Get him! "
7960,False,"What a thrilling bout!"
7961,False,"Knock him flat!"
7962,False,"Next, I put this here..."
7963,False,"I've never had such a delicious banana!"
7964,False,"Give me a bite!"
7965,False,"Such a nice breeze... Hmm..."
7966,False,"Zzz..."
7967,False,"Now, where will our next hunt be?"
7968,False,"Why not hunt near the tsoly?"
7969,False,"One day, I'll be telling stories here..."
7970,False,"A lofty goal, but I believe you can reach it."
7971,False,"Sounds like the Brethren of Br'aax caught something big."
7972,False,"I'm not surprised─they're the best of us, after all."
7973,False,"Did you hear what Zereel Ja said? "
7974,False,"Yes, but I'm not sure if we can manage it..."
7975,False,"Our stores have been empty for a long while!"
7976,False,"We can't depend only on deliveries anymore..."
7977,False,"Are you all right?"
7978,False,"Y-Yes, it's just a scratch..."
7979,False,"What in the world happened...?"
7980,False,"We'll get through this! "
7981,False,"Unnngh..."
7982,False,"The Skyruin has broken free!?"
7983,False,"Thank goodness, the wound is shallow."
7984,False,"What was that great shadow...?"
7985,False,"I want to go and see the castle!"
7986,False,"We'll go once I've caught my breath, all right?"
7987,False,"Sounds like we'll be riding the air cab, then..."
7988,False,"Say, why don't we have a race?"
7989,False,"Have you gotten any faster since last time?"
7990,False,"I doubt he has..."

8011,False,"Hmmm..."
8012,False,"This is tough!"
8013,False,"One last precaution...just in case."
8014,False,"Hmm? Is someone there?"
8015,False,"...I'd better hurry."

8799,False,"Five, six, seven, eight..."
8800,False,"Having the Cosmoliner makes all the difference."
8801,False,"Our hard work really paid off!"
8802,False,"Hm-hm-hmmm～♪"
8803,False,"Boop, boop!"
8804,False,"Battery packs, check.<hex:02100103>Supplies, check..."
8805,False,"Projections indicate we'll hit our supply targets."
8806,False,"Phew... Let's take a breather, shall we?"
8807,False,"Mechanical supplies go over there!"
8808,False,"If only my family could see this..."
8809,False,"But I don't need to breathe..."
8810,False,"As for the nearby resources..."

8820,False,"We have enough. Excellent."
8821,False,"My inspection proceeds apace!"
8822,False,"An amazing tunnel, isn't it?"
8823,False,"Yes, truly. Can you please take this from me already?"
8824,False,"We can pierce a little further, methinks."
8825,False,"Next, we come to transportation..."
8826,False,"Wait... I think we're missing one."
8827,False,"Are you sure you didn't miscount?"

8841,False,"Freedom..."
8842,False,"So what's coming in the shipment? Besides Archon loaf, I mean."
8843,False,"Is that a new type of carrot? How exciting! "
8844,False,"(Should I break the news...?)"
8845,False,"An unidentified flying object! I swear it!"
8846,False,"Mumukko's looking for me?<hex:02100103>Ugh, not now! I'm busy!"
8847,False,"Let me check the equipment rental deadline..."
8848,False,"Psst! They're calling for you!"

8854,False,"You there! Back to work!"
8855,False,"Hmm... What am I in the mood for?"
8856,False,"The Loporrits are so wonderfully fuzzy!"
8857,False,"Have you piloted before?"
8858,False,"I-I haven't the courage..."
8859,False,"I was thinking salad, or maybe soup."
8860,False,"Chock-full of carrots!"
8861,False,"Excuse me, where shall I put this?"
8862,False,"Just a moment, please!"
8863,False,"Today I'm in the mood for..."
8864,False,"Say, about the upcoming project..."
8865,False,"Bizarre weather, I'm telling you..."
8866,False,"Beautiful."
8867,False,"Space is so vast..."
8868,False,"<sigh> Rest at last."
8869,False,"Well earned, if you ask me."
8870,False,"Oh my..."
8871,False,"For the carrot seasoning, take care to..."
8872,False,"N-No, it's delicious... (Urp...)"
8873,False,"We all know that's not true..."
8874,False,"The data we've gleaned is promising indeed."
8875,False,"Is this a new flavor?"
8876,False,"I call it the lunar blend! What do you think of it?"
8877,False,"Mmm... Not bad,<hex:02100103>I suppose."
8878,False,"It must be in my<hex:02100103>quarters─it <hex:021A020203>must<hex:021A020103>!"
8879,False,"<sigh> I'll just file a lost property report..."
8880,False,"I hear there's a new item in the vending machines."
8881,False,"At long last! I am a pilot!<hex:02100103><hex:021A020203>Zroooooom<hex:021A020103>!"
8882,False,"These mechs aren't toys, you know."
8883,False,"I'm sorry... <sniff>"
8884,False,"Perfect."
8885,False,"Perfect!"
8886,False,"...Good enough,<hex:02100103>I suppose."
8887,False,"Did you bring your exotablet?"
8888,False,"Of course I did!<hex:02100103>Why, it's right here in my..."
8889,False,"Uh... I'll be right back."
8890,False,"Burn... Burn... Burn...!"
8891,False,"Buffoons, all of them...<hex:02100103>Have they honestly not a moment to spare?"
8892,False,"Behold...the nadir lift!"
8893,False,"Plenty of carrots... Check!"
8894,False,"Plenty of Archon loaf... Check!"
8895,False,"Would you two <hex:021A020203>please<hex:021A020103> take stock of something other than rations?"
8896,False,"Simply enchanting, all of it..."
8897,False,"I hear there's quicksand fields over yonder."
8898,False,"Would that we could survey them with drones..."
8899,False,"Battery functions normal..."
8900,False,"Watch your step!"
8901,False,"I would, if my exotablet had service here!"
8902,False,"We're low on carrots...<hex:02100103>Do tell them to send more!"
8903,False,"Ohhh, this flavor is heavenly!"
8904,False,"Shall I request aid from the base?"
8905,False,"Yes! More carrots, please!"
8906,False,"Can they deliver them this far out...?"
8907,False,"I'll request a case of Archon loaf, and..."
8908,False,"Carrots! Lots and lots of them!"
8909,False,"It's always the rations with you two..."
8910,False,"Oh, to be a mammet at work..."
8911,False,"The work's nothing if not invigorating!"
8912,False,"Phew...<hex:02100103>That's quite a ways down."
8913,False,"Oh! I... I think I'm actually good at this!"
8914,False,"You are! Very good indeed!"
8915,False,"We'll entrust you with<hex:02100103>welding from here on out."
8916,False,"We must archive these environs for posterity."
8917,False,"To think plants could flourish down here..."
8918,False,"Well, they <hex:021A020203>do<hex:021A020103> seem to get plenty of sunlight."
8919,False,"This should make a fine memento."
8920,False,"Hooray!"
8921,False,"Oho, this'll make a fine photo!"
8922,False,"And with the tap of a button..."
8923,False,"An inspection a day keeps the repair technician away!"
8924,False,"Now to check the samples we found..."
8925,False,"Apparently, the visitors from Etheirys are on their way as we speak."
8926,False,"Let me check where this shipment is needed..."
8927,False,"We better get going soon."
8928,False,"Five...more...minutes..."
8929,False,"Don't come crying to me if Mumukko catches you lazing about!"
8930,False,"What if the Cosmoliner messes up my hair? I spend hours each morning teasing each strand into place!"
8931,False,"Don't tell me we forgot to pack extra hair wax..."
8932,False,"Remember, the schedule is all important!"
8933,False,"Hup, hup! Hup, hup!"
8934,False,"The base is this way!"
8935,False,"This way, this way!"
8936,False,"I wonder how they're faring back on the moon."
8937,False,"It's up to us to explore this sector! We can't let the initiative down!"
8938,False,"Exploring the deep rifts in Phaenna's surface will be a real challenge."
8939,False,"In an emergency, the plan is to..."
8940,False,"Checking energy levels..."
8941,False,"Energy levels: tip-top!"
8942,False,"Energy levels: nearly depleted!<hex:02100103>You need a slice of Archon loaf!"
8943,False,"O-Oh!? Er...thank you?"
8944,False,"We'd like these transported next!"
8945,False,"Beautiful. Really beautiful."
8946,False,"As for upcoming projects..."
8947,False,"It's around here somewhere..."
8948,False,"How long does he expect me to wait?"
8949,False,"Don't eat the glass here─it isn't candy."
8950,False,"I'll be strong enough to carry fifty carrots! No─one <hex:021A020203>hundred<hex:021A020103> carrots!"
8951,False,"Vacuum suits are so powerful!"
8952,False,"A tonze of carrots is nothing to them!"
8953,False,"I'll develop a taste for this stuff, or die trying. Urp..."
8954,False,"Ha! Don't push yourself."
8955,False,"Do you think our suits will be upgraded soon?"
8956,False,"Time to work already?"
8957,False,"It's over here! I'm sure of it!"
8958,False,"Let me check just once more!"
8959,False,"Is he <hex:021A020203>still<hex:021A020103> looking!?"
8960,False,"Good grief, not again..."
8961,False,"Where should I take this?"
8962,False,"Hold on just a moment."
8963,False,"We can expect more shipments from the moon, I'm sure."
8964,False,"Maybe I should change my vocation to “box carrier.”"
8965,False,"You've certainly got the arms for it. I-I mean, you're quite strong."
8966,False,"We're ready for a test flight, I think."
8967,False,"I'll see if I can schedule a time."
8968,False,"Yes! Maintenance is finally over!"
8969,False,"Can you carry that to the habitation module?"
8970,False,"Carrying is what I do best!"
8971,False,"We seem to be missing some machinery..."
8972,False,"I'll send in a request."
8973,False,"Plenty of glass here. Just not much to eat..."
8974,False,"Shipments from the moon should keep us from starving, at least."
8975,False,"Wouldn't it be nice if we could cultivate our own food?"
8976,False,"We made a list, but does it look feasible?"
8977,False,"Let's see... Hmm..."
8978,False,"Judging by the strata, we can estimate the age of this cavern..."
8979,False,"I should reread the data."
8980,False,"It's absolutely essential!"
8981,False,"Let's consult with Phasingway."
8982,False,"Tastes like...health."
8983,False,"Those glass protrusions look almost like bubbles."
8984,False,"I can't help but wonder how they formed."
8985,False,"Meteorologically speaking, this star is particularly noteworthy..."
8986,False,"As far as the next star goes..."
8987,False,"We've been contacted as well."
8988,False,"Or a fabric made of glass fibers... What do you think?"
8989,False,"You might be onto something!"
8990,False,"...What was our team supposed to be doing, again?"
8991,False,"I'll ask Mumukko."
8992,False,"Er... Um..."
8993,False,"It can melt about anything, really."
8994,False,"What about glass?"
8995,False,"I can't get enough of these carrot drinks!"
8996,False,"We've noticed, haha."
8997,False,"Drink too many, and you might sprout bunny ears."
8998,False,"Phaenna's glass is truly remarkable."
8999,False,"I wonder what we'll find on the next star..."
9000,False,"So, how do we speed this crater cooling business along?"
9001,False,"I say we increase coolant distribution!"
9002,False,"It's altogether too hot here!"
9003,False,"Nothin' a good dose o' coolant won't fix!"
9004,False,"I think we should double up on observation drone patrols."
9005,False,"Can't quite...reach..."
9006,False,"If only I was an ilm or two taller!"
9007,False,"Time to get going."
9008,False,"Ungh... W-Wait...!"
9009,False,"A nibble on a nice nourishing carrot'll soon boost your strength!"
9010,False,"Vessel 7 ought to be back soon..."
9011,False,"The mechanism's completely fried... Better bring it back to base for repair."
9012,False,"I don't want to see you clambering into the cockpit again! Are we clear?"
9013,False,"Forgive me I don't quite believe you..."
9014,False,"Listen, I've got some errands to run. No funny business while I'm gone!"
9015,False,"As crystal!"
9016,False,"Toodle-oo!"
9017,False,"Surely a little peek at the cockpit won't do any harm..."
9018,False,"What's all this!?"
9019,False,"I knew I couldn't trust you!"
9020,False,"Wahoo! This is so much fun!"
9021,False,"It's not safe up there! Besides, you can hardly reach the controls!"
9022,False,"Sorry, sorry... The cockpit was calling out to me!"
9023,False,"Better run a quick systems check."
9024,False,"Fully functional."
9025,False,"Now for a test flight."

9200,False,"I'm sure their heart would sing just as ours do."
9201,False,"Dartorgor...is here?"
9202,False,"Indeed. She always will be, so long as we remember her."
9203,False,"Hee hee! We love this game!"
9204,False,"Getting...dizzy..."
9205,False,"We'll need to ensure we have ample supplies."

9214,False,"The areas by the crater are completely frozen..."
9215,False,"Glass rain is accumulating at the base of Capsule Chasm!"
9216,False,"Sounds like the glass rain's caused some incidents..."
9217,False,"Good work, everyone!"
9218,False,"That should be it for the repairs... Onto cleanup."
9219,False,"Severe thunderstorms are approaching!"
9220,False,"Severe thunderstorms are approaching!"
9221,False,"Annealing winds are approaching! We expect temperatures to plummet..."
9222,False,"Annealing winds are on their way... Expect severe drops in temperature."
9223,False,"We've got large quantities of glass rain incoming!"
9224,False,"We've observed an oncoming glass dust storm..."
9225,False,"Our machinery could be in grave danger!"
9226,False,"If the storms get too close, we're in trouble..."
9227,False,"We'll need to ensure the cave doesn't freeze over..."
9228,False,"The frigid air might force a system shutdown..."
9229,False,"The way the wind's blowing, the crater might suffer damage."
9230,False,"Take care not to slip on the dust as it approaches."
9231,False,"Please deliver your supplies here!"
9232,False,"Seems our job here is done! Let's withdraw."
9233,False,"Seems the alert's been lifted. We'll take care of the rest!"
9234,False,"The alert's been lifted! Many thanks for your cooperation."
9235,False,"Now comes the cleanup..."
9236,False,"Impeccable timing! The repair supply team is this way!"
9237,False,"This is the machine repair hub! Please deliver your supplies here!"
9238,False,"That should do it...!"
9239,False,"We'll need all the help we can get in the plateau!"
9240,False,"Good timing! I'll leave the top to you!"
9241,False,"You can leave this area to us."

9250,False,"Gods, this is dangerous!"
9251,False,"Just don't act rashly, and you won't get hurt."
9252,False,"We'll need some assistance harvesting plants and sampling the soil."
9253,False,"A rare specimen indeed..."
9254,False,"All right... Time to install these new parts!"
9255,False,"Oil suppliers, this way!"
9256,False,"Time to show them what you're made of, fishies... Literally."
9257,False,"Dust collectors, over here!"
9258,False,"Phew... The tank's nearly filled!"
9259,False,"We'll clean this up in one fell swoop."
9260,False,"Now to take some specimens for further study..."
9261,False,"The water quality is...<hex:02100103>Hmm. Intriguing."
9262,False,"We must needs survey deepwater impesctors in their natural habitat."
9263,False,"Backup supplies will be a necessity..."
9264,False,"We should be able to find a use for these..."
9265,False,"Glass rain... Astounding, yet vaguely terrifying."
9266,False,"Oh, no... Is the dust filter clogged!?"
9267,False,"A “Phaenna” if ever I saw one!"
9268,False,"This star is incredible!"
9269,False,"Health and safety first! Time for calisthenics!"
9270,False,"One, two! Three, four!"
9271,False,"Five, six! Seven, eight!"
9272,False,"Schedule... Schedule..."
9273,False,"...And a few for my comrades on the moon."
9274,False,"A new star! Can you believe it?"
9275,False,"I can't wait to start exploring."
9276,False,"And I can't wait for this loaf to be finished..."
9277,False,"I wonder what facilities we'll build here!"
9278,False,"A proper kitchen, hopefully..."
9279,False,"You'll be as pretty as polished glass."
9280,False,"We'll polish till you shine!"
9281,False,"What shall come of this, I wonder?"
9282,False,"I can't stop the picture fever!"
9283,False,"Let's give it our all, everyone!"
9284,False,"Aye aye!"
9285,False,"Making good progress, I see. Let's keep it up!"
9286,False,"Quickly and carefully, please!"
9287,False,"Take that, glass!"
9288,False,"Rrrgh... The ground is surprisingly tough!"
9289,False,"Leave this to me!"
9290,False,"This way!"
9291,False,"Over here!"
9292,False,"To the new Glassblowers' Beacon!"
9293,False,"Say, “Carrots, please!”"
9294,False,"It's beautiful!"
9295,False,"Huzzah!"
9296,False,"All right, I'm taking it!"
9297,False,"We did a fine job, if I do say so myself."
9298,False,"Try not to blur it this time..."
9299,False,"A big step forward."
9300,False,"And a bit of rest, at last."
9301,False,"Just me and my mech. <sigh> What precious moments..."
9302,False,"Keep up the good work, everyone!"
9303,False,"Even the most mundane scenes are worth a snap, in my book!"
9304,False,"Keep those inspections thorough!"
9305,False,"Take extra care─we can't afford any mistakes!"
9306,False,"No issues detected!"
9307,False,"I've never seen you trundle so energetically!"
9308,False,"You're the cutest mini rover in the fleet!"
9309,False,"When you factor in freight costs, we may as well be hauling gold around."
9310,False,"Behold, Phaenna's very own Cosmoliner!"
9311,False,"Three, two, one!"
9312,False,"Hold still!"
9313,False,"You're standing too close! You won't get us all in frame!"
9314,False,"Raw materials take precedence! Rations can wait."
9315,False,"Surely they'd make an exception for carrots?"
9316,False,"You polish up well, my mechanized friend."
9317,False,"Musn't overlook even the tiniest flaw..."
9318,False,"Faultless construction!"
9319,False,"Keep on trundlin', little feller!"
9320,False,"At last, Phaenna has a sparkling new habitation module!"
9321,False,"Looks like we'll be waiting on proper food supplies for a while longer..."
9322,False,"<sigh> No end in sight to the Archon loaf diet..."
9323,False,"Huh? Where've they gotten to this time?"
9324,False,"Hellooo?"
9325,False,"Tsk, I've never met someone so work-shy!"
9326,False,"Nap first, work later..."
9327,False,"Take a moment to admire these wonderful facilities!"
9328,False,"I don't know about you, but all this glass is starting to look rather appetizing!"
9329,False,"Err, I think we'd better get you to the infirmary..."
9330,False,"The finest welds on Phaenna─even if I do say so myself!"
9331,False,"Slow and steady..."
9332,False,"Time to weld like I've never welded before!"
9333,False,"Look at our lovely new mech hangar!"
9334,False,"I'd say that was a job well done!"
9335,False,"Hear, hear!"
9336,False,"Now I just need a hot meal..."
9337,False,"Looks like a proper base of operations now, eh?"
9338,False,"It's all coming together."
9339,False,"Best do some maintenance while we have the time."
9340,False,"Is it properly charged?"
9341,False,"Drill's in good shape."
9342,False,"Thanks for always hangin' in there."
9343,False,"Let's wipe it down."
9344,False,"Dirt, begone!"
9345,False,"Not even a speck of dust will remain!"
9346,False,"Raaah! I'm gonna dig like no one's ever dug before!"
9347,False,"The base is truly beginning to take shape!"
9348,False,"That's it, I'm taking this up with Mumukko!"
9349,False,"She does seem like she's fine with a diet of Archon loaf..."
9350,False,"Being fussy about the details is what it means to be an artisan."
9351,False,"When you're careless, it shows up in your work."
9352,False,"J-Just the slightest bit nervous..."
9353,False,"Look at the mech hangar, in all its glory!"
9354,False,"It'd be nice to get a taste of what this star has to offer."
9355,False,"...Think we can eat an impesctor?"
9356,False,"Would you look at the cosmoport now!"
9357,False,"Dining on the odd farmed fish is a real treat."
9358,False,"Truly."
9359,False,"I'd forgotten to give it a try."
9360,False,"I saw it earlier! A shipment of supplies from the moon!"
9361,False,"You mean <hex:021A020203>food<hex:021A020103> supplies!? Something besides Archon loaf!?"
9362,False,"No chips on the blade."
9363,False,"Fully charged and ready to go."
9364,False,"I see some shards of glass jammed in there..."
9365,False,"At last, the base is complete!"
9366,False,"And so our maiden survey of a star in the cosmos comes to an end..."
9367,False,"It was hard work, but I couldn't have asked for a more fascinating environment."
9368,False,"Gods, a hot meal at last!"
9369,False,"Slow down, the food isn't running away."
9370,False,"I think someone's had their fill of Archon loaf..."
9371,False,"'Tis a blessed thing to enjoy a peaceful meal."
9372,False,"Certainly better than gnawing on Archon loaf as we work."
9373,False,"Carrots, please!"
9374,False,"Good work as always, partner."
9375,False,"Let's make it squeaky clean for the next star!"
9376,False,"Squeaky! Squeaky!"
9377,False,"Need to find the perfect angle..."
9378,False,"Materials appear to be running low. Better make a request to the team on the moon."
9379,False,"Even should the sights change, this flavor does not."
