1,"TEXT_FESSUM001_01534_SEQ_01","According to a roving chaperone of the Moonfire Faire, the Adventurers' Guild is looking for members willing to help with the festivities. As a proud <hex:02081BE905FF0C>guildswoman<hex:FF0A>guildsman<hex:03> and something of a sartorial adventurer, it would behoove you to slip on a <hex:02082AE905FF12>red lady's yukata<hex:FF13>blue lord's yukata<hex:03> and take yourself to the Aftcastle. If the chief chaperone, Haermaga, is all that he is promised to be, this transaction would prove to be in your favor.<hex:02100103><hex:02100103>※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone."
2,"TEXT_FESSUM001_01534_SEQ_02","Haermaga is a trifle vague on the rationale of these festivities, but quite clear on the matter of reward. In return for participating in three events, you will receive prizes, plus a special costume. Your summer wardrobe is a little lacking, and it would be well for the commonfolk to see what an adventurer is made of. And if that should prove insufficient motivation, do it for the children."
