2,"TEXT_CLSARC005_00071_SEQ_02","Silvairre grudgingly reveals his intention to leave the guild. He is determined to bring Pawah Mujuuk to justice, believing that it will grant him a measure of redemption for the time he failed to do so as a Quiverman. Realizing that you cannot sway him from his path, you resolve to turn your attention to Leih, who seems utterly crestfallen."
3,"TEXT_CLSARC005_00071_SEQ_03","As if Silvairre's announcement weren't shocking enough, Leih declares her intention to leave not only the guild, but Gridania at large. Before she departs, however, she would speak with you in private. Meet her in the South Shroud and see her off on her journey."

However, she could not bear to let Pawah murder you, and was thus denied the company of her kind. With nowhere left to go, she asks you to meet her at the Bannock, and help her to understand how one can live as an outsider in Gridania."
5,"TEXT_CLSARC005_00071_SEQ_05","Leih flies into a rage and attacks you, leaving you little choice but to fight, as a crowd of slack-jawed Twin Adder recruits look on. After you subdue her, she awakens as if from a trance, realizing that the fear of dishonoring her old family, who perished in the Calamity, was preventing her from embracing her new one. She resolves to return to the guild and be with those who know her best. Follow in her wake and inform Luciane that all is well."
6,"TEXT_CLSARC005_00071_SEQ_06","Before you can utter a word, Luciane bids you stop, and states that merely looking at the returning Leih's eyes has told her all that she needs to know.
