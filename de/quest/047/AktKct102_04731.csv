Before augmenting anything, however, there is the small matter of preparing suitable trade goods...which can then be exchanged for the rare and expensive components procured by the Boutique of Splendors. This, according to Grenoldt, is to be your job. Once you are done trading wares to Quinnana, Chora-Zoi will be waiting to take charge of both materials and tool for the next step of this splendorous endeavor.<hex:02100103><hex:02100103>※Please note that you may not proceed with a class or job that is different from when you accepted this quest."

The already masterful piece feels somehow more natural in your hand─a testament to the young artisan's consummate skill. With the first stage complete, you look forward to how the next stage of improvements will transform your tool of the trade."
