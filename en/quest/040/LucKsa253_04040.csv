Loaded into the Allagan node, along with the Resistance weapon, the refinement process thereafter is surprisingly painless. Almost suspiciously so. Zlatan and Gerolt then discuss the feasibility of repeating the refinement process, prompting an equally suspicious recording from the Allagan node, extolling wares from the House of Splendors that would save you the trouble of finding more artifacts, albeit at a price. Zlatan would not forbid you from purchasing from the House of Splendors, but he is understandably keen to avoid any unnecessary dealings with the notoriously unscrupulous Rowena."
