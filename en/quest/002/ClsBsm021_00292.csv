The requisite ore can be purchased from Smydhaemr, the guild supplier, but the essential fire shard will have to be obtained elsewhere. Craft a single bronze ingot and deliver it to Brithael."

However, he stresses that no amount of talent can make up for a lack of experience, and asks that you return for further training only after the fundamentals have become second nature to you.<hex:02100103><hex:02100103>※The next blacksmith quest will be available from Brithael upon reaching level 5."
