1,"TEXT_HEAVNY815_02392_SEQ_01","A pathetic sop of an adventurer heaps cloying praise upon you before promptly foisting upon you some task that he is either incapable of or unwilling to─mayhap both─perform himself. He quickly scampers off before supplying any of the relevant details, save that it involves lending your aid to one Khloe Aliapoh, a shopkeep at Rowena's Center for Cultural Promotion whose mere smile is seemingly sufficient to reduce the man to a stammering clod. Investigate and hope that you've seen the last of that sad buffoon."
2,"TEXT_HEAVNY815_02392_SEQ_02","You introduce yourself to Khloe Aliapoh, a charming Miqo'te girl with a love for telling stories of heroes and derring-do. She explains that recently she fears that her tales are starting to sound the same, and have not been lifting the spirits of her troubled friend as once they did. She furnishes you with a journal that she has dubbed Wondrous Tails, and entreats you to fill its pages with accounts of your own adventures, that she might draw inspiration from them to fashion new narratives of her own."
