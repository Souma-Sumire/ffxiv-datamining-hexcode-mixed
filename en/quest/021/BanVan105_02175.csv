1,"TEXT_BANVAN105_02175_SEQ_01","Muna Vanu tells you that your services are required by Luna Vanu. Though he has not been informed of the particulars, knowing well the current uncertainty surrounding the tribe's food supply, he has little doubt that you will be asked to assist in securing foodstuffs. Speak with him and find out.<hex:02100103><hex:02100103>※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level. Furthermore, you may not proceed with a class or job that is different from when you accepted this quest."
2,"TEXT_BANVAN105_02175_SEQ_02","Luna Vanu has a hunger for chigoes. Unfortunately, these quick and cautious creatures are notoriously difficult to catch. However, he suggests a tried-and-true technique that can bag these bugs. A full-grown sanuwa is capable of creating a gust of wind that can blast a chigoe clean from its nest. A fast hunter, lying in wait, can snatch up the bug while it lies dazed by the attack. Three large, old trees at the Gauntlet are likely to have chigoe nests in them. Luna Vanu will wait beneath these trees while you, on sanuwa-back, blast your quarry from its place of hiding.<hex:02100103><hex:02100103>※Speak with Luna Vanu in Ok' Gundu Nakki to mount a sanuwa."
3,"TEXT_BANVAN105_02175_SEQ_03","All goes according to plan. The sanuwa effortlessly throws the chigoe from its nest and within seconds Luna Vanu snaps up his prey. Spurred on by the fruitfulness of your efforts, Luna Vanu is eager to visit two more similar trees on the island and gather the bugs making nest within them.<hex:02100103><hex:02100103>※Speak with Luna Vanu in Ok' Gundu Nakki to mount a sanuwa."
4,"TEXT_BANVAN105_02175_SEQ_04","You once again blast a chigoe from its nest into Luna Vanu's waiting arms. One tree remains to be harvested.<hex:02100103><hex:02100103>※Speak with Luna Vanu in Ok' Gundu Nakki to mount a sanuwa."
5,"TEXT_BANVAN105_02175_SEQ_05","You catch yet another bug, fat and juicy, from the last of the trees suspected of housing chigoe nests. Satisfied with today's haul, Luna Vanu returns to the village. Return there yourself and let Muna Vanu know that your work is complete."
6,"TEXT_BANVAN105_02175_SEQ_06","Muna Vanu thanks you for your work. He offers his apologies that his tribesmen ate each and every chigoe without offering you so much as a bite─it seems the bugs were so succulent that all who tasted them could not stop themselves."
