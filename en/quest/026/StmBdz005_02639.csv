Your assistance is greatly appreciated. The drones were not in our possession for very long, but a cursory inspection showed they are made with a heretofore unknown metal alloy."
53,"TEXT_STMBDZ005_02639_GNIBNPHA_000_011","They are all but impervious to traditional firearms, which is why we commissioned Garlond Ironworks to fashion a weapon capable of penetrating their armor."

59,"TEXT_STMBDZ005_02639_LOEZKIRZ_000_021","We were quite fortunate for your presence. Save for Lieutenant G'nibnpha, none of my men can even activate a suit of magitek armor, let alone pilot one in combat."
60,"TEXT_STMBDZ005_02639_LOEZKIRZ_000_022","I only pray that isn't to our detriment in the future. There's still plenty more of those drones out there along Baelsar's Wall. If any more of them should suddenly stir..."
