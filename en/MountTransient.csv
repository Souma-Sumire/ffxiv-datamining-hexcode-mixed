1,"Summon your Grand Company-issued battle chocobo.","Born and bred in the city–state of Ishgard, the majority of company chocobos are geldings of the rouncey variety; however, massive destriers and miniature Belah'dian jennets are also raised to accommodate the builds of Roegadyn and Lalafellin riders respectively.","Chocobos are stout-<hex:02100103>hearted creatures, but<hex:02100103>they have their limits.<hex:02100103>  - Mimigun"

4,"Use the odd-shaped horn gifted to you by the wandering minstrel to call a massive goobbue to your side.","Traded for a song by the High Satrap of a distant land, the secret to taming these creatures once thought to be unbreakable was introduced to Eorzea by a mysterious wandering minstrel who journeyed through the realm in the final days before the Calamity.","Would that I had the<hex:02100103>girth of a goobbue!<hex:02100103>  - Nanamo Ul Namo"
5,"Five years and a realm-shaking Calamity were not enough to break the bonds between you and your loyal steed. A single whistle and he will be at your side once again.","In the five years following your sudden disappearance from the Carteneau Flats, your ever-faithful chocobo spent each waking moment galloping across the realm in search of his lost master.

Now, but a handful of skilled tamers living in recluse on the Pearl are<hex:02100103>said to be able to train them.","Hey, good lookin'!<hex:02100103>Catch my coeurl yet?<hex:02100103>  - Swygrael"

Ahrimans are believed to fall into the fifth, making them formidable foes...when not enthralled by curses.","Ye'd 'ave t' be blinder'n an<hex:02100103>ahriman wi' an eyepatch t'<hex:02100103>miss the camp.<hex:02100103>  - Baderon Tenfingers"

Despite objections from friends and family alike, she kept the beasts, eventually training them to serve as mounts.","Do not presume to<hex:02100103>provoke the behemoth to<hex:02100103>battle. You will die.<hex:02100103>  - Meurise"
19,"Summon your cavalry drake, trained by the drake whisperer of the Brotherhood of Ash.","Training a cavalry drake is a long and arduous process that begins the moment the scalekin hatches. Never allowed to see its mother, the creature is raised solely in the presence of a drake whisperer while being weaned on the incendiary glands of aged battle drakes to ensure it is both submissive and deadly.","You are as a lost kitten<hex:02100103>that has wandered into<hex:02100103>the drake's lair.<hex:02100103>  - Zagozz Teh"

21,"Call into battle your gilded suit of magitek armor. Its golden coating serves to resist magicks while impressing members of the opposite sex.","It only took a few heated skirmishes with the allied city–states for Garlemald to realize that the magicks wielded by the realm's mages were too much for even the thickest of magitek armor plating. Alloyed gilding has since been discovered to dampen the effects of elemental charges and is now standard-issue.","You ditched your magitek<hex:02100103>armor!?

22,"Summon forth the single-horned steed with a temperament as black as his coat.","While it is no secret that it was the enigmatic Ascians who provided the beast tribes with nightmares, their reasons for doing so remain shrouded in mystery.

27,"Summon forth a bevy of bombs who will bear you in comfort upon a hovering palanquin.","Upon learning that his creations were forever lacking the power to combust, 789th Order Acolyte Ba Go did what any master of explosives would─attach the bombs to the corners of an iron bench and create a floating coach.","Hack and slash and<hex:02100103>tossy-boom.

32,"Summon forth your fearless warlion to rule over the battlefield, such is his station as king of the beasts.","Early in the Sixth Astral Era, lions were brought over from the Near East and trained to serve as battle mounts for the Sultansworn of Ul'dah. Deemed unbreakable, those not sold to the Coliseum for venationes were released into the deserts of Thanalan where they eventually reverted back to a feral state.","I, too, see the friends<hex:02100103>I lost in the lions and<hex:02100103>spinners...<hex:02100103>  - Gregory"
33,"Summon forth your fearless warbear, veteran of a thousand battles, to fill your enemies with dread.","In generations past, warriors seeking fame and glory would journey out into the untamed wilds of Abalathia's Spine in search of the giant grizzled bears that roamed the mountains, and would wrestle the beasts into submission, riding their prizes back to civilization. That is, or die trying.","How do you like my<hex:02100103>pets? Not too playful<hex:02100103>for you, I hope?<hex:02100103>  - Beast Trainer"
34,"Summon forth your draught chocobo, a massive bird large and strong enough to bear two riders.","This heretofore unseen breed of chocobo was said to have been discovered by chocobo hunters searching for the legendary Chocobo Forest. Its enormous size would make it a fine pack chocobo, but its foul temper prevents it from completing even the simplest of tasks without the injury of some poor rider.","The thing was thrice my<hex:02100103>size and had already<hex:02100103>maimed several keeps.<hex:02100103>  - Battlewarden Ribald"
35,"Summon forth your deadly direwolf, one of five pups found huddling together in the snow near the corpse of their slain mother.","Mass cullings of the beasts during the Sixth Astral Era prompted naturalists to deem the species extinct.

36,"Summon forth your Maelstrom-issued warhorse and try to push from your mind the fact that your chocobo is sitting somewhere hungry and alone.","After witnessing dazzling demonstrations of how a warsteed might turn the tide of battle, the Grand Companies of Eorzea emptied their coffers at the feet of the Far Eastern uma bugyo, each seeking to put themselves at an advantage during Frontline campaigns.","Hoof to neigh, Eorzea<hex:02100103>knows not the horse for<hex:02100103>one reason: the horsebird.<hex:02100103>  - Uma Bugyo"

41,"Summon forth your ceremony chocobo, large enough to bear both you and your special someone.","Raised by Ishgard's master breeders for beauty and purity of stock, its snow white feathers are natural and, though fully developed, as soft as down.

42,"Summon forth Sleipnir─undying steed of the elder primal Odin. His coat is as dark as void, while his eyes glow a sanguine red.","Blessed by the elder primal himself, Sleipnir will forever remain loyal to those who have proven themselves worthy. In addition to being fearless in battle, the dark steed is also able to manipulate his corporeal form to accommodate any rider, large or small.","If it hadn't been<hex:02100103>for that horse...<hex:02100103>   - Erik"

44,"Summon forth your parade chocobo who, by the looks of him, has not marched in many parades.","Originally purchased by the Adventurers' Guild for use in festival parades, this portly steed quickly wore out his welcome by devouring a moon's worth of fodder in a single turn of the sun.

45,"Summon de forth your black de chocobo. ","A purebred Ishgardian black chocobo, trained from birth by House Fortemps knight, Ser Haurchefant, and presented to you in a gesture of true friendship.

46,"Summon forth your adamantoise mount. He(?) is actually quite faster than he appears.","Native to the Near Eastern island of Thavnair, adamantoises were long thought to be impossible to domesticate. However, through the efforts of both Ul'dahn naturalists and thaumaturges, a handful have been successfully trained not only to accept riders, but also wield ancient magicks which allow the colossal scalekin to fly.","M-Me?

47,"Summon forth Kirin, Far Eastern king of the beasts.","Ask any man in Othard who rules the realm of beasts, and you will receive the same answer─Kirin.

56,"Summon forth your war panther─a silent killer trained to maim anyone and everything...excepting you, of course.","While more difficult to train than their cousins the coeurls, panthers bring their riders much more advantage on the field due to the beasts' inherent affinity to various magic. It is also believed that many dark knight battle techniques were conceived by watching panthers hunt.","I have seen you<hex:02100103>move like a shadow.<hex:02100103>   - Daimbert"

It is also unable to shrink you to a size to fit in the cockpit, meaning you do not so much ride as you are dangled around in its tractor beam.","The <hex:021A020203>Truth<hex:021A020103> receives a large number<hex:02100103>of reports from readers claiming to have<hex:02100103>observed unidentified flying objects.<hex:02100103>   - Delion"
291,"Summon forth your vinegaroon mount, a carnivorous scalekin with a jaw reminiscent of claws.","While it is common for dragons to use vinegaroons as servants, men have struggled to domesticate the creatures.

292,"Summon forth your Orthos craklaw. May or may not have participated in famous battles which actually took place in history.","Discovered in Eureka Orthos, this specimen of craklaw was imbued with magic in a bid to further harden its carapace.

293,"Summon forth your bluefeather lynx mount, which could be what a certain feathered familiar might look like as a large, winged feline.","A phantom creation composed of the esoteric power of dynamis. It is believed that the Endsinger brought forth this mysterious entity, but for what purpose is unclear. Could it be a tribute, perhaps, bestowed upon one who has overcome her aria of despair?","The light of hope shall ever<hex:02100103>guide our steps so long as we<hex:02100103>have the will to press onward.<hex:02100103>   - Edmont de Fortemps"

300,"Summon forth your magicked umbrella to whisk you off your feet in the most delightful way.","This flying umbrella was created by a certain elderly mage in her youth. It uses a black umbrella as the base, the better for blending into the night and sneaking into the Great Gubal Library from above.

301,"Summon forth your magicked parasol, and have the whole world at your feet.","This flying parasol was created by a certain elderly mage in her youth. Intending to sell them en masse to fund her research, she chose a pink parasol─popular in those days─as the base.
